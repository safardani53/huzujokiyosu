In addition to concerns about animal welfare, opting for a plant-based diet and lifestyle can help protect the planet, reducing greenhouse gases exponentially.</p><p>It will also save an estimated £1.5trillion in damage to the planet and people’s health, according to researchers at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford.</a></p><p>Without realising, many of us are using animal-derived products in our everyday haircare products: cysteine, shellac, wax and lanolin, to name a few.</p><p>Keratin - a hair hero ingredient - is actually made of animal protein.</p><p>Haircare brands are responding to this increased demand for vegan products by launching new vegan ranges, vegan specific products or ensuring their entire hair care lines are vegan.</p><p>If a hair care product is labelled "vegan" or "cruelty-free", that means they contain plant-based ingredients and didn’t test on animals.</p><p>The belief used to be that vegan products didn't boast ingredients that were effective for cleansing, conditioning and nourishing hair, but vegan brands like The Body Shop, renowned for its 100 per cent vegan and cruelty-free ethos, are proof that couldn't be further from the truth.</p><p>The Body Shop's Banana range of products hydrate with the best of them.</p><p>Lush’s packaging-free vegan shampoo bars are kind to animals and also eliminate the need for the excess waste.</p><p>And new brands like Ethique and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Only Curls London</a> are out to transform vegan hair care for good.</p><h2>1.
