It‚Äôs practically <a href=#>girl math</a> that you need to be drinking more than one beverage at once.</p><p>That said, the latest TikTok fad, known as the morning duo, consists of drinking two drinks each morning, and users are claiming that this drink combo is rife with health benefits.</p><p>While the beverage combination appears to be safe if one tried to emulate it at home, it appears users aren't turning to the supermarket to get their drinks, but rather to beauty and nutrition multi-level marketing company called It Works, which has been dubbed a pyramid scheme online. Keep reading as we break down what the morning duo is, its alleged health benefits, and the company behind it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the morning duo drink on TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has brought mainstream popularity to a handful of drinks including <a href=#>whipped coffee</a>, and <a href=#>Starbucks's medicine ball</a> and did wonders for <a href=#>cherry tart juice's reputation</a> after users claimed it helped them go to sleep.</p><p>The latest beverage or rather beverage set on TikTok gaining traction is what is being called the morning duo. Essentially, the morning duo is drinking a cup of aloe vera followed by a cup of coffee. These drinks are intended to be consumed one after the other for a laundry list of health benefits.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are the alleged health benefits of morning duo drink on TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok users claim that consuming the morning duo will lead to weight loss, less bloating, better skin, improve gut health, boost energy levels. There are many video of morning duo devotees sharing before and after photos of their body after implementing the morning duo into daily routine.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@allisonmesserr href=#>@allisonmesserr</a><p>Let me help ya! <a title=morningduo href=#>#morningduo</a> <a title=guthealth href=#>#guthealth</a> <a title=bloatedstomach href=#>#bloatedstomach</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=glowup href=#>#glowup</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Stick Season MC4D Remix - MC4D" href=#>‚ô¨ Stick Season MC4D Remix - MC4D</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the morning duo drink recipe?</h2><p>The morning duo is one cup of aloe vera followed by one cup of coffee. But, you're probably wondering how users are getting drinkable aloe vera? Before you go stocking up on the succulent plant, aloe vera juice does exist and can be be purchased at popular retailers like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CVS</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Target</a>. It is safe to drink daily and similar to coffee, the beverage does offer some health benefits. But you likely wouldn't see as drastic results as the girls on TikTok.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jesss1516 href=#>@jesss1516</a><p>Replying to @Meg my morning duo changed the game for me!

Historically MLMs don't have shining reputations as some rely on false health claims and prey on vulnerable people. That said, it begs the question: Is It Works a legit brand or a pyramid scheme?</p><p>It's hard to tell without having a medical expert evaluate the ingredients in It Works products. But many folks on the internet are leaning towards yes.</p><p>One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">user on TikTok even wrote, </a>"It Works = pyramid scheme that glorifies eating disorders."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pyramid Scheme - It Works! - This is their poaching scheme on Social Media.
