"Whatever numbers come into my head I pick."</p><p>Along with Nguyen's jackpot, the market where he bought the ticket will receive $1million.</p><p>"We don’t have final plans yet for the money,"&nbsp;said Chris Deoff, president of Dehoff's Key <span id=3cc38e5e-12cb-4567-9c4f-ba4f12462a85 class=suggested-link>Markets</span> in a statement.</p><p>"We have all kinds of improvements for the stores that we are always working on and we are discussing other things. This is a nice windfall since the margins in our business are so thin."</p><p>In the past, the market sold a $10,000 winning ticket but nothing compared to this.</p><p>Nguyen has no immediate plans for the money yet but said that he doesn't want the win to go to his head.</p><p>"I just want to be a normal man," he said.</p><h2>LUMP VS ANNUITY</h2><p>A lump sum payment means lottery winners can accept a one-time cash payout.</p><p>Although the winner would be losing a chunk of their payout to taxes, it's likely they would lose more over time with annual payouts.</p><p>"To invest better you need to not only choose a good, low-cost, diversified portfolio," the founding partner of Barrister, <span id=e9289968-4a73-4d52-8ec5-62f0d9fe82e9 class=suggested-link>Charles</span> Weeks, said via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a>.</p><p>"You will also need to make sure you control your emotions in good markets and bad."</p><p>Douglas Boneparth of Bone Fide Wealth in&nbsp;<a href=#>New York</a>&nbsp;added: "It's all about scale. If it's a smaller amount, the risk is proportionally higher.</p><p>However, when one wins the lottery and chooses an annuity, installments are paid out as one immediate payment followed by a series of annual payments.</p><p>This means that for years, even decades, money is guaranteed to come in.</p><p>However, many cons exist in this scenario. The group making the payout over the years could run out of money, for one.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Another issue: the winner could die before collecting their total earnings.</p><p>With <a href=#>tax</a> rates at an undetermined amount, they could likely increase throughout the years of the annual payouts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/person-plays-lottery-store-us-833327851.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbYRxfo9saWion6yys67ApaNmpJ%2Bpwaa%2B2Gauoqaemr9ur8CloJ%2BnoqO2onnVoqWhZZ6cwrqxzWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-rohrer-raising-kids-ex-wife-new-husband-under-same-roof.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Retired NFL Pro Jeff Rohrer Raising Kids with Ex-Wife, Husband</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rick-chryst.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Rick Chryst net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
