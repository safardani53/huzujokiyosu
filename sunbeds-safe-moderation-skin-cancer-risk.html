the deadliest form of skin cancer - studies have shown.</p><h2>Are they linked to skin cancer?</h2><p>Yes, many organisations say so.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)</a>, there is significant evidence to show that using tanning beds causes melanoma.</p><p>They report that sunbeds increase the risk of skin cancer by up to 20 per cent, and also state that they have no positive benefits to our health.</p><p>Cancer Research back this statistic, adding that " there is no such thing as a safe tan from UV radiation".</p><p>One study found that sunbeds&nbsp;can almost <a href=#>double the risk of cancer</a> compared to never using them - with women 83 per cent more likely to develop the disease.</p><p>While some people think tanning beds are safer than sitting out in the midday sun, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cancer Research</a>, the risk is still twice as high when compared to spending the same amount of time in the Mediterranean sun at lunch time.</p><p>The Sunbed Association claim there is not enough evidence to link sunbed use with melanoma, adding: "It is over-exposure and <a href=#>burning </a>that will increase a risk of skin cancer, not responsible UV exposure."</p><p>But the WHO says: "The majority of tanning parlours provide inadequate advice to their customers.</p><p>"The use of eye protection such as goggles or sunglasses should be mandatory.</p><p>"However, as sunbed users aim to have an even tan, they often decide against protecting any part of their body."</p><p>Referring to the link with skin cancer, the world health experts add: "Sunbeds for self-tanning purposes have been available for the last two decades and due to the long latency period for <a href=#>skin cancer</a> and <a href=#>eye damage</a> it has been difficult so far to demonstrate any long-term health effects.</p><p>"Even though the causes of malignant melanoma are not fully understood, tumour development appears to be linked to occasional exposure to intense sunlight.</p><p>"Sunbeds subject their users to intermittent high exposures of UVA and UVB radiation – this may provide the ideal setting for the development of malignant skin cancer.</p><p>"However, the few epidemiological studies that have been carried out to date have not provided any consistent results."</p><p>Despite the WHO's cautious stance on the skin cancer link, it discourages the use of sunbeds, quoting an expert who said the use of tanning parlours is like "an industrial-scale radiation exposure experiment".</p><h2 class=article__content--intro>Everything you need to know about Cancer</h2><h2>What other harms are there?</h2><p>Regardless of skin cancer, sunbeds don't just have long-term health risks.</p><p>Users have reported a range of short-term symptoms including itching, dryness and redness of skin, freckling and photosensitivity.</p><p>Common outcomes in the longer term, especially in fair-skinned people, may involve blistering of the skin.</p><p>"<a href=#>Sagging and wrinkling</a> of the skin are an almost certain price to be paid by frequent sunbed users", the WHO says - not quite the outcome you hope for when going to the sunbed shop for a beautiful, youthful look.</p><h2>Who should avoid sunbeds at all cost?</h2><p>The WHO has expressed concern that "approximately 40 per cent of sunbed users in the United Kingdom have fair skin".</p><p>People with fair skin among other characteristics are the most at risk of skin cancer.</p><p>The NHS says that you should not use sun beds, sunlamps or tanning booths if you:</p><ul><li>have fair or sensitive skin</li><li>have a history of sunburn (especially in childhood)</li><li>have red hair and freckles</li><li>have lots of moles</li><li>are taking any creams or medication that could increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight</li><li>have a medical condition that can be made worse by sunlight</li><li>have had skin cancer previously</li><li>already have sun burn</li></ul><p>In 2010 the Sunbeds (Regulation) Act made it illegal for people under the age of 18 to use sunbeds. Anyone with a sunbed business is committing an offence if they offer tanning services to people under the age of 18.</p><h2>Our Dying For A Tan campaign</h2><p>The Sun's Fabulous launched the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dying For A Tan campaign</a> to raise awareness of the dangers associated with sunbed use.</p><p>It tells the stories of women who have lost an eye to cancer, had huge holes gauged out of their skin, and been left looking decades older than their age - all because of sunbeds.</p><p>"It's really important that people understand the dangers of tanning," <a href=#>said a spokesperson</a> for the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD).</p><p>"The truth is that a tan is a sign of skin damage.</p><p>“The idea that tanned skin looks both healthy and attractive needs to be challenged.</p><p>"However, this is difficult as we have developed a cultural obsession with tanning, something that is constantly perpetuated through social media, television, and the internet."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXx4fJBpaW1oX6jCr67Enapmq5Gbsm65zp2cq5mknryvedKkoKdlk5a7pLHRZqmiq5tk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashley-fonda-and-alika-medeiros-dating-naked-stars-married.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ashley Fonda and Alika Medeiros: Dating Naked Stars Married!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alan-titchmarsh-novels-not-as-saucy-now-older.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alan Titchmarsh says his novels arent as saucy now hes an OAP</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
