It started in May 2021, and three months later, it is still going on.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Paytas used to do a podcast with YouTuber Ethan Klein called Frenemies. Ethan is best known for his channels, h3h3 Productions&nbsp;and H3 Podcast, which he runs with his wife, Hila Klein.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Paytas left Frenemies because of misunderstandings and monetary disputes.&nbsp;Paytas had been in a positive light when they were in Frenemies, but they have been involved in a fair share of drama since the conflict.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As a result, their fanbase is turning against them.&nbsp;Since Paytas is engaged to Hila's brother Moses Hacmon, the petty internet drama has families involved.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Happened between Trisha and Donna?</h2><p>Recently, Ethan's mom, Donna Klein, also got involved in the feud when she called out Paytas for their behavior. This happened after <a href=# rel=follow>Paytas</a> went to Keemstar's podcast, Mom's Basement.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Keemstar posted a picture of himself with Paytas and his co-host Faze Banks, on August 15, 2021. Keemstar was flipping the camera off, with Paytas sitting between the hosts wearing Frenemies merch.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ethan shared the picture and said he was disappointed that Paytas would go to his enemy's podcast. Donna, supporting her son, called Paytas a "weasel" and claimed that she would not go to their wedding with Hacmon.</p><p>Since then, Paytas made videos and tweets about Donna, calling her evil and comparing her to 'Satan.' They claimed Donna was trying to ruin their relationship and family.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Paytas kept talking about a text Donna sent to their fiancé and said it was the cruelest thing anyone said to them. Everyone was wondering what the text was. So, Donna revealed the text and exposed Paytas on Families, a podcast she hosts with Ethan.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>What Did Donna Text Trisha?</h2><p>Donna addressed the scandal on the ninth episode of Families,&nbsp;released on August 23, 2021. Before she revealed what the text was, Donna gave a little backstory to build the context.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Hila and Ethan had been trying very hard to get pregnant. They have a young son, Theodore, but they wanted to expand&nbsp;their precious family. After a lot of treatments and procedures, Hila finally conceived.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple announced their pregnancy live on their podcast, H3 After Dark, on May 29, 2021. The doctor had told them to be careful since&nbsp;Hila was pregnant with over one kid. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As a result, she was supposed to be careful and stress-free. Instead, soon after Kleins announced their pregnancy, Paytas publicly fought with Ethan.&nbsp;</p><p>The drama was getting out of hand for the family, so they worried Hila might miscarry. Since Hila was in a vulnerable situation, it was a likely scenario.&nbsp;</p><p>Donna was scared and worried&nbsp;for her son, daughter-in-law, and her unborn grandchildren. Therefore, she took matters into her hand and texted Hacmon on Facebook Messenger.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She said that if Hila had a miscarriage because of Paytas and their dramas, she would hold the couple responsible.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Moses, if your sister has a miscarriage because of this stress, I will hold you and Trisha responsible. Stop this nonsense. ENOUGH!</p><p>Paytas had claimed that Ethan knew about the text and allowed his mom to blame them. But Ethan clarified Paytas’ accusations and said that he did not know until they told him.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Similarly, he claimed he was horrified when he saw the messages but understood where his mother was coming from.&nbsp;He also added that everyone in the family was scared that Hila might miscarry — Donna was the only one who said it aloud.&nbsp;</p><p>While the drama did not end, fortunately, Hila is safe and sound. The pair revealed they are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">expecting only one child</a> and not triplets. Hila constantly gives updates about her pregnancy on her Instagram.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Currently, their unborn baby is the size of an avocado. Ethan promised that this was the last time they would talk about Paytas. After that, he blocked them on all his social media platforms.</p><p>On the other hand, Paytas uploaded a video and went on a Twitter rant. They&nbsp;uploaded a video&nbsp;titled ‘I’m not staying silent on this,’ on August 23, 2021, addressing Ethan and his mom.&nbsp;Like the title of the video, Paytas defended themselves&nbsp;and continued to drag the Kleins.</p><p>Out of all the other claims, they said&nbsp;that Donna texted other people in Hacmon’s family about blaming the pair if Hila miscarried.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Similarly, Paytas was adamant that Ethan knew about the text. They also said that Donna is neither their&nbsp;nor Hacmon's family, so she is not invited to the wedding.&nbsp;The Kleins have not responded to Paytas' video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyinsCprYypmLKskah6pbvNp5hmo5yatq950pyYp5yRoXupwMyl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ram-ben-barak.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Ram Ben-Barak net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./country-comfort-griffin-mcintyre-leann-rimes-performance-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Country Comforts Griffin McIntyre On Singing With LeAnn Rimes Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
