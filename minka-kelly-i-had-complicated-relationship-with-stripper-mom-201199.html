In the October issue of Cosmopolitan magazine (as excerpted by the Daily Mail) <strong>Derek Jeter'</strong>s 31-year-old ex-girlfriend opens up about the "pretty complicated" relationship she had with her stripper mother, Maureen Kelly prior to her death in 2008.</p><p>"She was 5'11"," the Charlie's Angels&nbsp;star explains. "Legs up to her ears, gorgeous. She got along on that for as long as she could."</p><p>Kelly says her mother would sometimes wake her up in the middle of the night when she got home from working at the strip club. The mother-daughter duo would then go to the supermarket shopping. "That was like our big Friday," she recalls. "She would want me to skip school [the next morning]… I was like 'No, Mom, I've gotta go to school!'"</p><p>Kelly's mother chose to raise her daughter as a single parent. The actress' father, onetime <strong>Aerosmith</strong> guitarist Rick Dufay, "wanted to try the family thing," but Kelly says her mom "was too busy having fun."</p><p>"It wasn't like he didn't want to be part of our lives," the Friday Night Lights star adds.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Minka and other stars who've romanced athletes</a></p><p>"I didn't know how to appreciate what good friends we were," Kelly admits. "Because I just wanted her to be my mom."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sadly, three years ago, Kelly's mother died of colon cancer. "That's detectable," Kelly says. "Talk about being reckless and not paying attention to your body."</p><p>Fortunately, the two made peace with each other before it was too late. "By the time [my mom] passed I was holding her," Kelly says. "I was with her until her last breath. We made it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamoZ6grm63xKWjsmWZYrWisIycpqaonJ6wosDEnWSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdrLa1tIysq6uhoKWys3nMqKRmamBmfnqFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ex-on-the-beach-la-venganza-de-los-ex-no-puedes-manejar-la-verdad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mallory-edens-represents-bucks-at-draft-lottery-nearly-breaks-tw.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mallory Edens Represents Bucks at Draft Lottery, Nearly Breaks Twitter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
