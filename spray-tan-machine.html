And despite their claims of superior performance, not every machine delivers on their claims. But don't you worry! Here is a buyer's guide to help you find a suitable system:</p><h3>Types of Spray Tan Machines</h3><p>Once you start searching, you'll come across various types of spray tan machines. While there are other methods of spray tanning, for our purposes below we have only discussed two types of spray tan machines in detail below:</p><h4>LVLP (low volume low pressure) spray tan systems</h4><p>LVLP spray tan gun systems are turbine-driven and operate at lower pressure, but the low pressure means you have to use it more precisely. They give off a fine mist that not only dries quickly but is less messy as well. Plus, you can also adjust the spray pattern according to your needs.</p><h4>HVLP (high volume low pressure) spray tan systems</h4><p>These spray tan systems are more popular because they are more efficient, fast and simple to use. The HVLP gun with a pressure rating between 4 and 10 PSI (pound per square inch) tends to produce a finer spray that offers better coverage with little overspray.</p><h3>Factors To Consider in a Spray Tan Machine</h3><p>Choosing a spray tan machine is not very easy. Here are some features that you must pay attention to:</p><h4>Material</h4><p>Whether you are purchasing the spray tan machine for your personal use or for your mobile sunless tan business, the material used in its construction is an important consideration. Look for a unit that is made using high-quality, durable and sturdy materials so that the machine will last you for a long time.</p><h4>Accessories</h4><p>Some spray tan machines come as standalone units, others are supplied as kits complete with various accessories to achieve a flawless tanned look. This includes tanning solutions in various intensities, nose plugs to keep it out of your nose, disposable foot pads and sometimes a tent for a mess-free experience. The more accessories you get, the less you will be hassled while using the machine.</p><h4>Capacity</h4><p>A tan machine needs at least two ounces of tanning solution to cover an average body from head to toe. So you should aim for getting a machine that can hold two ounces of solution at a minimum. And if you like to have a deeper tan or are bigger than the average size, consider a machine with four ounces capacity.</p><h4>Pressure system</h4><p>As we already mentioned above, spray tan guns are categorized into HVLP or LVLP according to their pressure system. HVLP systems are more popular for at-home usage because they are lightweight, quiet and more efficient. LVLP units, on the other hand, tend to be louder and slower. It comes down to your personal preference so choose accordingly.</p><h4>Maintenance</h4><p>The biggest reason many consumers refrain from buying a spray tan machine is the mess they leave behind. But don't you worry. There are many models that provide excellent tan with minimal cleanup. When looking at the different models, make sure to check their overspray. The models with little to no overspray rating are the ones you should look into getting. Additionally, you should also check to make sure that the cups are not leaky. Lastly, having a tent helps contain the tanning solution mist. Hence, if a spray tanning kit includes one, you should seriously consider getting it.</p><h4>Noise</h4><p>Spray tan guns employ air compressors as a part of their construction, hence they tend to be pretty loud. For a mobile tanning business, this can be an issue because you'll be spraying people for hours and a high decibel output can have a devastating impact on your hearing. Plus, the loud noise will prevent communication between you and your client. So you should carefully check the decibel rating of the machine you are considering buying.</p><p>Many buyers assume that a machine with a smaller compressor will be quieter. But that's not the case, rather it's the complete opposite. Spray tan machines with larger air compressors tend to be quieter because they don't have to work as hard. If your chosen machine is louder than your liking, you can look into getting sound boxes to restore peace and quiet.</p><h4>Portability</h4><p>When it comes to portability, spray tan machines differ verily. Some are available as small units for home use or traveling. Some are designed for maximum mobility. While the rest are professional-grade units that are meant to be used in a fixed location.</p><p>So if you are getting one for personal usage, choose a lightweight machine that is easy to maneuver. But if it's for your mobile spray tanning business, go for a gun that is easy to pack and carry around. Lastly, if you are installing one in a professional setting, a large system will work the best.</p><h3>Tips for Using a Spray Tan Machine</h3><p>Here are some tips to make the most of your spray tan machine:</p><ul><li>If you have not shaved or waxed, do so at least a day before receiving the tan. If your pores are open they'll absorb the solution and appear like dark spots.</li><li>Exfoliate your skin the day before. It helps smoothen your skin so the tanning solution adheres evenly sans unsightly splotches.</li><li>Avoid using deodorant both before and after spray tan application. When applied before tanning, it creates a barrier that prevents the solution from absorbing. And if applied afterward, the chemicals inside it react with the tanning solution creating a greenish shade on your skin.</li><li>Protect your palms by applying a barrier cream and your hair by using a shower cap. Applying a little moisturizer keeps your eyebrows safe.</li><li>Use the machine in a well-ventilated room. Hold it about two to six inches away from your body.</li><li>Start the tanning process from your feet and gradually make your way upwards.</li><li>After application, wait for the solution to dry to avoid rubbing off. Once it has dried, you have to wait for about six to eight hours for the color to develop. Don't bathe before that.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwvMSrqqimkaF6pK3RnmasqKKWxm7AwKdkppmTnbavsY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lizzy-mcalpine-19990921-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lizzy McAlpine (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hannah-feder-11ux-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hannah Feder (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
