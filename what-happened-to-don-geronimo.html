Don also referred to Sharla as "that chick."</p><p>Not surprisingly, the sexist off-the-cuff and not-so-funny jokes didn't go down well with his employers, and his job was quickly eliminated.</p><p>As Aaron Hyland, iHeartMedia’s D.C. regional president, explained in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>, “After an internal review, Don Geronimo is no longer an employee of WBIG.

No woman should experience this in the workplace, and I appreciate the Commanders’ swift response in handling this matter.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Social media is divided on Don Geronimo's firing.</h2><p>Interestingly, Don found many supporters on social media following his head-scratching and disrespectful comments <a href=#>about a co-worker</a>. Many people felt what he said did not rise to the level of being fired as a result, with one Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, "Seriously?
