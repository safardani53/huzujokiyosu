I mean, she is too young to be exposing all her information right away. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In this article, learn everything we know about the up and rising actress&nbsp;Lizzy Greene, from her childhood to her family life to her personal life.</p><h2>Lizzy Greene Usually Expresses Her Love For Her Parents On Social Media</h2><p>Lizzy Greene was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> on May 1, 2003, in Dallas, Texas of&nbsp;United States of America. Her birth name is&nbsp;Elizabeth Anne Greene.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The American actress who is often expressive of her love for her parents on social media has managed to keep the details of her parents private. That being said, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Legit</a>&nbsp;reports that&nbsp;her mother's name is Amy&nbsp;Greene, a former&nbsp;gymnast. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lizzy also has a sibling, an older brother, who goes by the name&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Garrett</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>She Has Been Rumored Of Dating A Few Boyfriends</h2><p>Over time,&nbsp;Lizzy Greene has been linked with a couple of her co-stars, creating rumors of her dating them.</p><p>To be precise, the rising actress in the initial days of her career was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumored</a> of dating her former&nbsp;Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn co-star Mace Coronel&nbsp;back in 2015.&nbsp;However, none of them ever confirmed or even hinted that they ever dated. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The two had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">portrayed</a> the roles of Dawn Harper&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dicky Harper&nbsp;â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹(two of four&nbsp;quadruplets) in Nickelodeon's comedy family drama show.</p><p>Similarly,&nbsp;Greene has also been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumored</a> of dating actor Ricardo Hurtado from February 2018 to June 2018. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hurtado</a> is popular for his&nbsp;role as Freddy on Nickelodeon television series School of Rock (2016) and his role as Tyler on Netflix TV series Malibu Rescue (2019).</p><p>The two were also seen attending various&nbsp;Nickelodeon programs and events together, including during <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Kids' Choice Awards Press Junket</a> on March 23, 2018, in Inglewood, California, and during the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nickelodeon Halo Awards</a> on November 5, 2017, in&nbsp;New York City. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Lizzy Greene and Ricardo Hurtado during The Kids' Choice Awards Press Junket in 2018 (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images</a>)</strong></p><p>But again, like&nbsp;Greene's previous rumor with&nbsp;Mace Coronel, the rumor with&nbsp;Hurtado also never got confirmed nor got denied in public.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>To many's surprise, Hurtado recently on November 16, 2020, announced his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">engagement</a> with his girlfriend whose Instagram reads '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ZuZu Nova</a>.' The actor shared the news via his Instagram handle, posting a picture of the pair kissing and a caption that read, "She said yes!ðŸ’Â I can’t wait to be your husband.&nbsp;#enagaged."</p><p>Coming back to&nbsp;Greene, she has not disclosed her present relationship in the public. She may be single,&nbsp;or maybe she is committed to someone, but it is now fully up to the actress to share the details with her fans and followers. Hopefully, she would do it when she finds the right time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKiloa6ze8uisbOxXZy%2FprHNnmSan5Vir7DFxaugnqaUYr2ivsSnq6xmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kamp-koral-meet-moop-s1-e7-paramount.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years: Kamp Koral | Meet Moop (S1, E7) | Paramount+</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-bieber-between-two-ferns-with-zach-galifianakis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Bieber: Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
