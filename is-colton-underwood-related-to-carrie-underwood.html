Fans of professional football and reality television know all about <a href=#>Colton Underwood</a>, who was formally signed to the San Diego Chargers after playing defensive end at Illinois State for college.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After leaving football in the dust, Colton landed a spot as a contestant on <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> in 2018. He was so well-liked that he ended up appearing on the spin-off <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> before snagging the coveted role of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> in his very own season in 2019. One big question people have lately is whether these two popular celebrities are related to each other by blood or not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Colton Underwood related to Carrie Underwood?</h2><p>It turns out Colton and Carrie aren’t at all related. The only thing they have in common is their shared last name! Carrie responded to a tweet from the official Bachelor Twitter page writing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“@Colton Underwood #NoRelation.”</a> She was sure to add a crying laughing emoji with a red rose while breaking the news.</p><p>Before Carrie cleared the air, fans were convinced the celebs were siblings, distant cousins, or something of that nature. The truth of the matter is that even though they’re both super famous and have the same last name, their bloodlines aren’t linked.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram @carrieunderwood</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Colton Underwood and Carrie Underwood friends?</h2><p>It doesn’t look like Colton and Carrie have ever spent time together in person, so it’s highly unlikely they’ve ever established a genuine friendship. It’s important to note that they both have such vastly different careers keeping them super busy! Carrie announced her official Las Vegas residency at the Resort World Las Vegas and Casino, and the first show she had on Dec. 2, 2021, was totally sold out!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She recently performed live at CMA Country Christmas and hit the stage amongst some other major names at the <a href=#>Christmas in Rockefeller Center</a> event right after. Singing unforgettable, classic Christmas songs with such a beautiful voice comes naturally to her. In November, Carrie learned she'd been nominated for a couple of Grammy Awards thanks to her latest album “My Savior.” She'll possibly take home the Best Roots gospel album and Best Country Duo/Group Performance awards when the time comes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram @coltonunderwood</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Colton has remained super busy since leaving the NFL and being part of Bachelor Nation. His new <a href=#>Netflix</a> original TV show <a href=#>Coming Out Colton</a> showcases what his journey has been like as he does his best to embrace his truth and fit in with the LGBTQ community. There are six episodes of the show so far with no announcements yet about if there will be a second season.</p><p>As of now, Coming Out Colton is receiving mixed reviews from fans who have different opinions on what the show brings to the table. At the end of the day, Carrie and Colton have so much going on in their busy careers that it causes people to grow more and more curious about their personal lives. Regardless, they're simply not related.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBur86lq6imXaq7pbHRsKaonF2nsq2t056bZqyfYrCivtGinGatnpmys8POqJs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kyle-cooke-claims-bethenny-frankel-is-exploiting-raquel-leviss-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kyle Cooke Claims Bethenny Frankel Is Exploiting Raquel Leviss</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-chamberlain-favorite-coffee-shop-nyc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emma Chamberlain Reveals Her Favorite NYC Coffee Shop (EXCLUSIVE)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
