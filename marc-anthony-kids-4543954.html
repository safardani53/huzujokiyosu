He is a father to seven children, whom he shares with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>previous partners</a>: twins <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emme</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Max</strong></a>, both 14, with ex-wife <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>; sons <strong>Cristian</strong>, 21, and <strong>Ryan</strong>, 19, with ex-wife <strong>Dayanara Torres</strong>; and daughter <strong>Ariana</strong>, 28, and son <strong>Chase</strong>, 26, with ex-girlfriend <strong>Debbie Rosado</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Two weeks after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tying the knot</a> for a fourth time with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nadia Ferreira</strong></a>, the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> couple announced they were expecting a child</a>. “Best Valentine’s Gift Ever!!! Gracias Dios por esta bendición tan grande en nuestras vidas,” they wrote alongside an adorable photo of their hands caressing 23-year-old Nadia’s growing baby bump. The second sentence in their caption, translated from Spanish to English, said, “Thank you God for this big blessing in our lives”. The pair <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their child</a> on Father’s Day 2023, feeling has equally blessed!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Marc has been open in the past about his distant relationship with his children. “The one regret would be what I chose to do took so much of my time,” he said on CBS This Morning in 2016. “What I would have done to be a stay-at-home dad and, you know, witnessed every second of everything. I would have loved that. It didn’t work out that way.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>He also admitted that he’d always “wonder” whether or not his career was worth time away from the kids. “It’s the one thing that just tugs at me going…that’s the biggest sacrifice,” he shared.

The two were previously married between 2004 and 2014. Born on February 22, 2008 in Long Island, New York, Emme is perhaps one of the singer’s most well-known children, having made several red carpet appearances alongside her famous parents.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Don’t be surprised if the teenager follows in her parents’ footsteps as singers: <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emme famously took the stage</a> during her mom’s 2020 Super Bowl halftime show with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shakira</strong></a> in February 2020 and participated in a mashup of “Let’s Get Loud” and “Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)” alongside other young singers. No one was more proud than dad Marc, who shared a photo of his daughter onstage on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> and wrote, “Emme Daddy is so proud of you. You are my ❤ and I am forever yours.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In June 2022, Jennifer performed in Los Angeles and once again invited Emme up onstage. She introduced the teenager to the audience <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>using ‘they/them’ pronouns</a>. This was the first time anyone in the family had publicly acknowledged Emme’s gender identity. Jennifer has primary custody of both Max and Emme.</p><h2>Marc’s 7th Child</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>“God’s timing is always perfect,” Marc &nbsp;wrote via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> in both English and Spanish. “Happy Father’s Day.” Marc and his new wife Nadia revealed the first photo of their first child together hours after welcoming the bundle of love into their world on June 18. While the pair were happy to share the news with his millions of followers, they did not reveal the gender or the name of their child.</p><h2>Max Muniz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/max-marc-anthony-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Max, born <strong>Maximilian David</strong> <strong>Muñiz</strong>, is Marc’s second child with ex-wife J.Lo and twin of Emme. Similarly born on February 22, 2008 in Long Island, New York, Max is relatively more low key than his sister, but he has made several public appearances with his famous parents in the past, including his dad’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Valentine’s Day show in New York</a> in 2009. He also showed up on the set of American Idol when his mom served as a judge in 2011.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Despite his young age, Max is already an activist in the making. While on the cover of the February 2021 issue of Elle, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>J.Lo revealed that her son emboldened</a> her to use her platform for social change amid the Black Lives Matter movement. “He wanted me to make sure I realized that I had power and that I should use it,” J.Lo said. “I&nbsp;thought that was very insightful. It was one of those parenting moments when you’re like, ‘Oh, maybe I’m raising a conscientious, kind, loving kid here.'”</p><h2>Ariana Muniz</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Marc shares daughter Ariana, his firstborn, with former girlfriend Debbie Rosado, a police officer from Puerto Rico. The two previously dated in the 1990s.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Not too much is known about Ariana, but she does follow in her father’s footsteps with a career in the arts. Ariana is an actress, and according to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb page</a>, she has starred in the TV series South Beach, a drama that follows two best friends who leave their lives in Brooklyn, New York behind and move to South Beach, Miami. Marc’s oldest child leads a fairly private life, so not too much else is known about her.</p><h2>Cristian Muniz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cristian-marc-anthony-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Cristian, born <strong>Cristian Marcus Muñiz,</strong> is one of two sons that Marc shares with ex-wife Dayanara Torres, a singer, actress, and winner of the 1993 Miss Universe beauty pageant. The two were previously married between 2000 and 2004.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Born on February 5, 2001, Cristian studies art and design in New York, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hola</a>!&nbsp;Judging from his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, Cristian is an excellent artist. He has created digital renderings of Marvel characters, including Dr. Strange and Carnage from Venom. He’s always a big fan of Disney+ series The Mandalorian and its breakout character Baby Yoda, having shared a series of images that feature the little guy.</p><h2>Ryan Muniz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ryan-adrian-marc-anthony-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Ryan, born <strong>Ryan Adrian Muñiz</strong>, is Marc’s second child with Dayanara. Born on August 16, 2003, Ryan is relatively more low key than his brother. It’s unclear if he’s on social media, but his proud mom has often shared photos and videos of him on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> page.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>In one particular birthday <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post, Dayanara shared a clip of Ryan’s many talents, including playing the drums and guitar, singing (like his famous father), and enjoying a bunch of sports, like soccer, football, baseball, snowboarding, and motorbiking. The kid has practically done it all. The proud mom called her son talented in her hashtags, and that much is apparent.</p><h2>Chase Muniz</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Marc shares son Chase, born <strong>Alex&nbsp;“Chase”&nbsp;Muñiz</strong>, with former girlfriend Debbie. Born on June 5, 1995, Chase was adopted by Marc and Debbie, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hola</a>! Unlike much of his well-known siblings, Chase lives a low key life, meaning there isn’t much known about him publicly.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>He appears to have a bond with his step-siblings, though. While Chase does not appear to be on social media, his former stepmom J.Lo once shared a rare snapshot of him with his dad and five other siblings on Instagram, although the photo has since been deleted. The sweet photo came after the passing of Marc’s mother <strong>Guillermina Quiñones </strong>in 2017. The singer wrote that her ex-husband was “surrounded by love” amid the sad loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yaqZxlkaPBqbvNsmSkoZSoenWBk2xwbmxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pupinia-stewart-19981016-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pupinia Stewart (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./donald-trump.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Donald Trump- Latest News &amp;amp; Stories - The US Sun</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
