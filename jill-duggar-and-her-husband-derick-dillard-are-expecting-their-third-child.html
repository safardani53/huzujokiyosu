On February 27, the 30-year-old reality star and her husband announced the good news on their official website, explaining that they had been keeping the former’s pregnancy “a little secret” from their followers.</p><p>“We’ve prayed that if it’s God’s will, he’ll bless us with another child. We are thrilled to share that God has heard our prayers and that our rainbow baby is expected in July 2022!”</p><p>Jill Duggar and Derick Dillard had a miscarriage. With the 32-year-old Derick Dillard, the Counting On star already has two children, Israel David (6) and Samuel Scott (4). Unfortunately, the couple, who had planned to name their child River Bliss, miscarried in 2021. The pair went on to say:</p><p>“We are very grateful for a healthy baby and pregnancy so far, and we can’t wait to find out the gender!”</p><h2></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jill-Duggar-2.jpg alt="Jill Duggar" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jill Duggar and Derick Dillard went to their social media accounts in October 2021 to disclose that they had lost their baby by releasing a video on Instagram and YouTube of the moment they found out they were pregnant for the first time. Another video showed them informing their two boys that another baby was on the way and celebrating with a pizza party. However, they were soon brokenhearted. The couple reported on their website that their children were thrilled when they learned of her pregnancy.</p><p>“They were full of questions and excitement as we discussed the pregnancy and how they would be engaged throughout the process and after the baby was delivered. However, we began miscarrying a few days later.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jill-Duggar-1.jpg alt="Jill Duggar" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The couple also disclosed the name of their unborn child, River Bliss Dillard, and said they would remember their child for the rest of their lives. They noted that River represents “tranquility” since rivers are frequently a quiet and lovely natural getaway. Jill later said on Instagram that the family needs time to regroup.’ She said they had spent more time together as a family and resumed their usual routines.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihoqScYrG2s8aaqWaZnpl6qbHRZp%2Buq5KWu6V5w56popubYrGquMuaqZ1lkaeybrHXqZycrJmjtG7Ax56gq2WknbazsIycn6KklGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-mom-ryan-edwards-girlfriend-kicked-out-bar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teen Mom star Ryan Edwards and rehab girlfriend Amanda Conner kicked out of bar after brawl breaks o</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-whishaw-dating-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Whishaws Dating Life Since Split From Ex Mark Bradshaw</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
