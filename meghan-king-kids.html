Her first marriage was to lawyer Brad McDill, whom she met at the University of Mississippi. They tied the knot back in 2007, but their marriage culminated in divorce in 2011. Little is known about Brad outside of the fact that he was married to Meghan as he has lived a very private life, even post-divorce.</p><p>Following her marriage to Brad, Meghan met Jim Edmonds, a former professional baseball center fielder and a broadcaster for Bally Sports Midwest. The duo happily wed in 2014, and he would go on to be the father of Meghan's three children.</p><p>Unfortunately, things didn't end up working out and the couple split in 2019. That didn't set Jim back permanently in the romantic department, however, as he and his new girlfriend, Kortnie O'Connor, got engaged in August 2021, shortly after his and Meghan's divorce was finalized in May 2021.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meghan King's most recent marriage ended in a quick divorce.</h2><p>Meghan and Cuffe Biden Owens, President Joe Biden's nephew, were married in October 2021.</p><p>Sadly, she and Cuffe haven't been able to make it work and are shockingly calling it quits just a couple months after tying the knot.</p><p>Questions initially arose after Meghan shared a series of Christmas snapshots of her and her children, but with Cuffe noticeably missing.</p><p>Then, in a series of Instagram stories on Dec. 27, 2021, Meghan opened up about the split. "This situation is profoundly devastating," she wrote. "This is obviously not what I imagined when I made my vows — and I'm shocked and saddened by the way things turned out. I am moving forward with my children as we privately process our pain and begin to let go of shattered dreams."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>She also wrote on her stories: "At this time I ask for your grace and gentle kindness as I navigate this labyrinth of grief with my family."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Meghan King's net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Meghan King has a net worth that is hovering somewhere around $5 million.
