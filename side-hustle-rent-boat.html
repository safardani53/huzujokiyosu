Rent them out for others to enjoy too.</p><p>Mike, who’s based in <a href=#>Virginia</a> and is an active full-time member of the military, today owns jet skis, kayaks, a motorcycle, RV, a Tesla and several other cars.</p><p>“I wanted jet skis but I couldn't afford to have them myself,” Mike Henrie told The Sun.&nbsp;</p><p>“And I couldn't justify the expense of that just to have fun.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about side hustles">Read more about side hustles</h2><p>So what was his solution? The 48-year-old turned his passion for jet skis into a thriving business.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike has a master’s degree in percussion performance from Brigham Young University and initially graduated college to pursue teaching.</p><p>But when September 11 happened, Mike changed his career path, enlisting to become an Air Force musician.</p><p>It was at this time he and his wife began building a cabin in western <a href=#>North Carolina</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><h2>Ready to rent</h2><p>Naturally, when Mike moved to <a href=#>Alaska</a>, it made economic sense to rent out the cabin, essentially as an Airbnb experience before Airbnb was popular, Mike said.</p><p>However, it was this experience that was the spark for Mike’s other side hustles.</p><p>As a musician, Mike stays on tours that keep him away from his car for weeks at a time.</p><p>After renting out his first smart car, he bought another one, plus a Camaro off Facebook Marketplace before putting all of them on the Turo platform.</p><p>By renting out his Tesla on a website called Turo, he’s able to bring in up to $10,000 yearly.</p><p>Turo is a car sharing marketplace platform that allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles in over 56 countries.</p><h2>Extra cash</h2><p>But that wasn’t enough for Mike, who kept thinking about new avenues to make money.</p><p>So he invested in some jet skis, and by using the rental platform GetMyBoat, he makes around $6,000 yearly.</p><p>He also bought an RV, which brings in a steady stream of income as well.</p><p>He charges $499 for the jet skis per day, while the <a href=#>Tesla</a> goes for $124 a day.</p><p>His motorcycle costs between $50 and $90 to rent.</p><p>The average income for a GetMyBoat owner is over $25,000 annually.</p><p>Of course, the amount you can make varies by location.</p><p>In <a href=#>Chicago</a>, the average yearly income is $32,910 for a boat owner or captain.</p><p>In Austin, that number is $16,367.</p><h2>Maintaining the side hustle</h2><p>Mike said the amount you can make is dependent on how much time you put into it.</p><p>He also has to spend money to make money, often paying thousands of dollars in repairs yearly.</p><p>Still, Mike said the jet skis have more than paid themselves off, and he finds his side business undeniably worth it.</p><p>“It's definitely not for everybody,” Mike said, adding his wife would never take on the same side venture he has.</p><p>“She said it’s too much of a headache,” Mike said. “But I feel like it's a wonderful opportunity to meet new people.&nbsp;</p><p>“You're meeting all kinds of people from rich to poor and from all walks of life, and you get to share your joys with them.”</p><p>In total, Mike earns up to $150,000 a year from his side hustles.</p><h2>More side hustle success</h2><p>Mark Holcomb, a pilot living in Austin, <a href=#>Texas</a>, has also found success using the GetMyBoat platform to charter his luxury pontoon.</p><p>He is able to rent it out for around $150 an hour, depending on the number of people on the boat.&nbsp;</p><p>This earns Mark a net income of around $50,000 a year, which has been helpful after he was laid off from a full-time tech job.</p><p>Some seasons do better than others.&nbsp;</p><p>In January, Mark is likely to only get three charters, but in a summer month, there’s around a dozen.</p><p>No matter the season, Mark stresses the importance of being safety-oriented.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, every charter means strangers on your boat, and that could be someone who doesn’t know how to swim well or a drunken partygoer.</p><p>“You don't know who's going to show up,” Mark said. “So you have to always err on the side of safety.&nbsp;</p><p>“You have to be a full stack individual where you need to be friendly and be very prompt in your communication.”</p><p>Both prominent GetMyBoat owners, Mark and Mike would never go back to the days before launching their side hustle.</p><p>As side hustles become more and more typical, with an estimated 45 percent of Americans having a side hustle in 2022 <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">according to a study</a>, Mike believes people are looking for something they can’t get from their full-time jobs.</p><p>“People are not satisfied with just a nine to five because sometimes there's not the creativity,” Mike said.</p><p>With his businesses, Mike gets to be social and he also gets to indulge in his photography interest, regularly taking pictures on the jet skis for marketing purposes.</p><p>The rise of <a href=#>side hustles</a> is no doubt in part due to <a href=#>inflation</a> as well.</p><p>As budgets are pushed to the edge, more Americans are looking for ways to bring in some extra revenue.</p><p>GetMyBoat is just one example of this in action.</p><p>“Everything's getting more expensive,” Mark said. “You need to make more money so people are investigating other avenues to make a buck in this world.”</p><h2>Taxing times</h2><p>It’s important to note, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) states if you are a self-employed individual, generally you are required to file an annual return and pay estimated taxes quarterly.</p><p>You have to file an income tax return if your net earnings from self-employment are $400 or more.</p><p>If your net earnings from self-employment is less than $400, you still have to file an income tax return if you meet any other filing requirement listed in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Form 1040</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US
