At one point, one of the guys in their group went up to Amanda and grabbed her by the face.&nbsp;</p><p>“Amanda came back at him and started slinging chairs to go after the guy. The bouncers grabbed the guy and kicked him out. Amanda was able to get her last hit in before they got her out too.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Ryan Edwards ">Read more on Ryan Edwards</h2><p>“Ryan tried to get to Amanda, but he was dragged out by bouncers as well. Ryan and Amanda left the bar together on foot.”</p><p>The insider continued that while the couple were not seen drinking alcohol, Ryan could be heard “slurring his words” and appeared “out of it.”</p><p>Ryan currently lives in a halfway house on CADAS Rehab's property, as he is allowed to sign out.</p><p>Ryan's lawyer did not immediately respond to The U.S. Sun's request for comment.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>BAD ROMANCE</h2><p>Ryan <a href=#>met Amanda in rehab</a> when he was released from prison in July.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Sun obtained exclusive photos of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan and Amanda walking from their halfway house</a>, which is on the same property as CADAS, to the main building for group therapies and workshops on August 15.</p><p>A source previously told The U.S. Sun: "They met and started seeing each other at rehab. He doesn’t take anyone on his bike unless it’s a thing. No friends [are allowed].”</p><p>The source continued to The U.S. Sun of Ryan’s new relationship: “Choosing to use your time on and the type of people you’re surrounding yourself with is not okay.&nbsp;</p><p>“This girl is dangerous.”</p><p>A source close to Amanda previously told The U.S. Sun that she is infamous in Chattanooga, Tennessee because of her bad girl reputation.&nbsp;</p><p>The insider claimed: “Amanda is trouble. She has been in and out of the system since she was old enough to catch a charge.</p><p>"She is not a good influence on Ryan.”</p><p>Over the weekend, Amanda <a href=#>posted NSFW photos of her and Ryan in bed</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Amanda, who <a href=#>once appeared on Jerry Springer</a>, has <a href=#>been in and out of jail</a> from around 2009 to a few months ago on drug possession, driving under the influence and more charges.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>PLEA DEAL</h2><p>The shocking new video comes just weeks after Judge Gary Starnes approved Ryan’s plea deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Ryan appeared<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;in court on November 6</a>&nbsp;and accepted a plea deal in his case for possession of a controlled substance, simple possession and driving under the influence.&nbsp;</p><p>Coty Wamp for the District Attorney's Office began in court: "The proposal is that for the sentence he was on probation for, we will reinstate him. Level two probation, he will plead guilty to the DUI with 11 months and 29 days time served.</p><p>"For possession of controlled substance, he will plead guilty with 11 months and 29 days time served."</p><p>The jail sentence for both charges was suspended and to be completed on probation instead.</p><p>Ryan will continue to undergo drug tests and is required to return to Chattanooga for them if he is working out of town, or else his probation with be violated.</p><p>On October 7, Ryan was busted driving 145mph in a 65mph zone.</p><p>He received a citation and was charged with reckless driving and other counts.</p><p>The lawyer for the state said of the speeding ticket: "The State is hesitant to agree to this, the reason is because of a citation in City Court on October 7. He was on radar going 145mph in a 65mph.</p><p>"Why he was not taken to jail? It should’ve been reckless endangerment. I don't think he's ready to succeed on any probation. I expressed concern to CADAS that he is not ready to take probation or bond conditions seriously."</p><p>The lawyer continued: "But taking the facts into consideration and the Oasis report that would indicate Mr. Edwards is doing well, the State has made this agreement."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>JUDGE'S DECISION</h2><p>Judge Starnes responded: “I will go over the plea agreement. On the original probation, you will be reinstated for 11 months and 29 days suspended. You will be on level two probation with random drug screenings.</p><p>"For the DUI case, you're pleading guilty. Eleven months and 29 days are suspended after you serve 48 hours, and you already served 48 hours.</p><p>"There will be a $465 fine plus, court costs. You lose your license for a year. You have to attend DUI school."</p><p>“For the simple possession, you will get drug screenings also. You're pleading guilty. Eleven months and 29 days time served.</p><p>"The possession of a controlled substance case is dismissed."</p><p>When asked if Ryan agreed to the deal, he accepted.</p><p>Judge Starnes continued: “I'm very hesitant to approve it. You going 145 in a 65 doesn’t show me remorse and the ignorance of doing something like that is beyond me. I don't know how you didn’t kill somebody.</p><p>"I don’t want to approve this. You have to give the court a comprehensive follow-up plan. There have been hiccups the entire world knows about."</p><p>“Continue what CADAS and Oasis recommended. I don’t want him out there with no follow-up program.</p><p>"You have the ability to do this, but you need to make good decisions. Going 145 on a motorcycle is not a good idea. He has to follow this program's recommendations."</p><p>The lawyer for the state recommended continuing Vivitrol injections, which curb addiction cravings, and counseling.</p><p>Judge Starnes said: "The Vivitrol injections have done really well, haven’t they? Let’s put that in the agreement. I want something submitted to me that you have set up at CADAS. I don’t want 90 days from now and you haven’t done anything.”</p><p>Judge Starnes ended the hearing: “Mr. Edwards we’ve gone over this many, many times. You have done well with the shots and CADAS treatments.</p><p>"You haven’t been good in your personal life. You’re looking at three years in custody. If you get on your motorcycle and decide you want to do it again, three years is a long time.”</p><p>Ryan was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">found guilty of the speeding charge</a>&nbsp;on November 8.&nbsp;</p><p>Ryan was originally&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sentenced to 11 months and 29 days</a>&nbsp;in Silverdale Detention Center in April for the possession of a controlled substance, simple possession and driving under the influence charges.</p><p>He was <a href=#>released to rehab in July</a> and to a halfway house in August.&nbsp;</p><p>He is due back in court on December 5.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>RYAN’S BUSTS</h2><p>Ryan has been in and out of jail since earlier this year on drug, harassment, and other charges.&nbsp;</p><p>He was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested on February 10, 2023 at his job for harassment</a>, possession of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">drug</a>&nbsp;paraphernalia, possession of a controlled substance, and order of protection violation.&nbsp;</p><p>He was then&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested for aggravated stalking</a>&nbsp;and violating a protection order on March 1 after authorities&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">issued two warrants for his arrest</a>&nbsp;on February 23.&nbsp;</p><p>Ryan&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pleaded guilty to the harassment charge</a>&nbsp;at a court hearing,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley's Reality Roundup</a>&nbsp;reported.</p><p>The former TV personality was ordered to complete rehab treatment and have no contact with the victim.</p><p>He was put on probation for 11 months and 29 days.</p><p>The possession of drug paraphernalia, stalking and order of protection violation charges were dismissed.</p><p>As for his possession of a controlled substance, he was sentenced to rehab with the option of the time being reduced for good behavior after six months.</p><p>He was then arrested on April 7 for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence arrest, which are the same charges as the plea deal, after the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Teen Mom OG</a>&nbsp;alum was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">found unconscious in the driver’s seat of his truck</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Ryan is <a href=#>currently going through a divorce with his estranged wife Mackenzie</a>, who he shares children Jagger, 4, and Stella, 3, with.</p><p>He also shares son Bentley, 14, with ex Maci Bookout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/ryan-edwards-amanda-conner-teen-843426443-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/teen-mom-star-ryan-edwards-862447936-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZ2iAeIWVaKuenZ5iurC5jKuwmqZdmrG4rdGdqmafmae5p77InqWdZZuesKyxw2amrqxdl66zew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inr5a7hpmuukxbu6ukjcfhk8jvsbedh7.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Go, Diego, Go!
