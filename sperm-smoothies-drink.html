My other mates think I'm strange, but I don't give a toss."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000446083739.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000280832336.jpg><p>Tracy, who is a vegan, roped her single pal into giving her his semen. She previously told how he pops round with a fresh tub three times a week.</p><p>"I know he's healthy, doesn't smoke, drink or do drugs and I made him have an STI check,” she said.</p><p>“When I first approached him, he was concerned I'd use it to impregnate myself.</p><p>“But once I'd convinced him it was for my beauty regime he agreed - after all, he has a regular supply at hand!"</p><p>Tracy, a qualified nutritional adviser and personal trainer, told how she kept it in her fridge.</p><p>She mixes the semen with fruit, seeds, coconut or almond milk – but is also happy to drink it on its own.</p><p>"Every batch tastes different, depending on what he's been eating,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000280832328.jpg><p>“If he's been drinking alcohol or eaten something particularly pungent like asparagus, I ask him to give me a heads up so I know not to drink it neat.</p><p>“Things like pineapple and peppermint make it taste better, but I'll happily take it straight off a spoon usually."</p><p>Tracy has filmed a YouTube video where she talks through her unusual remedy and explains what it tastes like.</p><p>“We look at its smoothness and texture, discuss its benefits and then I show people who I use a teaspoon to eat the sperm,” she said.</p><p>"Sperm&nbsp;is an awesome product and we should stop being so ridiculous about it – the health benefits have been well researched and more women and men should take advantage of it particularly as its made by our own bodies and doesn’t contain e-numbers and chemicals.”</p><p>For two years, <a href=#>Tracy, on the alleged advice of her beautician, has been using it as a skin product to help soothe her rosacea</a> – a condition that causes redness.</p><p>She mixes sperm with egg whites and lavender oil, then leaves it on her face for 15 minutes, three times a week.</p><p>She said: “I felt the need to share this information. People are so weird about sperm&nbsp;when in actual fact a teaspoon is filled with amazing goodness.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000280832337-e1478598174914.jpg><p>Although she has been single for three years, Tracy hopes to find love in the future – with someone who understands her lifestyle.</p><p>"I want a relationship where my partner asks if I want one shot or two shots of sperm in my smoothie each morning!"&nbsp;she said.</p><p>However, The Sun's Dr Carol Cooper blasted Tracy's flu remedy.</p><p>She said: "There's no scientific evidence whatsoever that drinking sperm will stop flu. Plus, depending on where the semen comes from, you could be at risk of catching viruses including HIV and Ziku.</p><p>"Semen does contain a lot of zinc compared to other bodily fluids but not in comparison to a vitamin tablet or food."</p><p>Dr Sarah Jarvis agreed, saying: “There is absolutely no nutritional value to semen. A better way for vegans to get extra protein would be through foods like nuts."</p><p>Follow her on Insta on: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.Instagram.com/tracykissdotcom&source=gmail&ust=1615463323870000&usg=AFQjCNF7ZIgriG0spfh1SNEYT4ZEmbPpKw">www.Instagram.com/tracykissdotcom</a></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in real life</h2></p><p>Meanwhile, beauty fans are going wild over a <a href=#>£24 Urban Decay setting spray</a> they claim kept their make-up in place during childbirth.</p><p>An acne sufferer has praised <a href=#>Makeup Revolution’s £9 Conceal and Define foundation</a> for camouflaging cystic spots and redness.</p><p>And shoppers are raving about <a href=#>Amazon's £10 best-selling lipstick</a> - with the "perfect" product receiving almost exclusively five star reviews.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Woman’s DNA test proves mum’s DOCTOR is her real dad after he mixed his own semen into sperm donor’s sample</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FqanFsYGx8tLzEq6Rmq52kvLW0yJ6qZpyinrusew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./byd5b3usq6zvlxp3sbpb7ta9ti4fvrp.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch SpongeBob SquarePants Season 6 Episode 6: A Life In A Day/Sun Bleached</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./side-hustle-rent-boat.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I earn up to $150,000 a year from rental side hustle - I started it to enjoy nice cars and jet skis,</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
