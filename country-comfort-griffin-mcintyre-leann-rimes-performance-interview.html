Griffin plays Dylan, the wise-cracking, ambitious middle child of the family. In addition to flexing his comedy skills, Griffin also gets to show off his amazing vocal and musical skills. He even gets a chance to perform “Can’t Fight The Moonlight” with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>LeAnn Rimes</strong></a> in an episode. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> spoke EXCLUSIVELY with Griffin about the experience — and how it almost never happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Country-ComfortGriffin-McIntyre-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I actually didn’t know that we were filming with her until a couple of weeks before we shot it because we were originally going to do it with someone else, and then COVID happened,” Griffin told<strong> HollywoodLife</strong>. “For LeAnn do it was just amazing. Obviously, to play piano and sing with her was a dream come true. It was a lot of fun. She’s the nicest person.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>With Country Comfort, Griffin got to experience being stuck smack dab in the middle of a family. “I am the oldest child in my family, so to be the middle child was very different,” the actor admitted. “It was a lot of fun to experience <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>older siblings</a> and younger siblings.” Unlike his character, Griffin has no plans to be a business manager one day. “I definitely want to be on the other side of that, the singing and acting part,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Country-ComfortGriffin-McIntyre-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Griffin is no stranger to performing. The 13-year-old has been playing the piano since he was 9 or 10 years old. “I love singing and playing piano. It’s what I love to do, and I’m also doing electric guitar right now,” he added. For as long as he can remember, Griffin has been drawn to performing.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I was a musical theater kid, and now I’ve gotten into acting,” Griffin said. “Musical theater and acting are alike, but I also love doing dance. I danced with Debbie Allen Dance Academy. I did that for a long time. I think I started when I was 5 or 6 up until 10. When I was shooting, I actually got to go back and do a couple of classes. That was so much fun.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Country-ComfortGriffin-McIntyre-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>It’s not a surprise that Griffin is incredibly talented. Performing is in his blood. His dad is none other than New Kids on the Block singer <strong>Joey McIntyre</strong>. Griffin revealed just how his dad gives him advice. “He gives me a lot of tips, but usually, they’re all on the stage,” Griffin said. “When he performs, I obviously want to be up there with him, and he gives me the chance to go out there with him. So that’s crazy and awesome. I feel like the tips are verbal sometimes, but they’re more in his actions on stage.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5FpZpynpaPBs8WMnKamnp%2BnwW6z0aKdn6GeYrqktc2tsKudXaGyorrNZqmipZWoerGx0Z%2Bmq6WRo7Cmecinq56qpp6yuHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./trisha-paytas-donna-klein-scandal-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Donna Klein Leaks What She Texted Trisha Paytas and Moses Trisha Strikes Back</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./boux-avenue-launch-matching-pyjama-mothers-day.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Boux Avenue has launched matching mum and daughter pyjama sets for Mother's Day - and prices start f</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
