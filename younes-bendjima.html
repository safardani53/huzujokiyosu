As a result, Younes landed his first major client, walking the runway as a runway model for Givenchy in 2013.</p><p>Younes currently represented Next Models. He has also modeled for Dolce & Gabbana, Balmain, Missoni, Calvin Klein, Hermès, Burberry, Marcelo Burlon, and Ralph Lauren, among others. He has also done editorial modeling for magazines such as Vogue Espana, Vogue Arabia, WWD, and Le Monde M Magazine.</p><p>Younes Bendjima is also a social media enthusiast, having amassed a sizable following as an Instagram Model, with over 1.1 million followers. Fortunately, Younes has graced the covers of numerous publications, including Vanity Teen, Bite, and Coitus.</p><p>He claims that because he is of Arabic descent, he has found it difficult to work in certain areas, particularly in France. It’s because certain types of models are in high demand in France.</p><p>Younes also has a positive relationship with Hermes, as he has stated that this is his favorite company to work for because of how classic and cool their designs are.</p><h2>Younes Bendjima Achievements And Awards</h2><p><strong>Younes</strong> is still a young man, and he has yet to receive any awards in his career. We will, however, update our list as soon as he receives one.</p><h2>Younes Bendjima’s Net Worth In 2023</h2><p><strong>Bendjima</strong> is worth $1 million as of December 2023, with an annual salary of $330,000. Bendjima began her modeling career as a boxer before signing with Next Management. These jobs have undoubtedly added significantly to his net worth. Other contracts with Elite in Copenhagen, Denmark, and I LOVE in Milan have also significantly contributed to his wealth.
