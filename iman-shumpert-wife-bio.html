However, in 2012, she decided to leave Star Trek in favor of the GOOD Music label, owned by one of the most well-known rappers of this era, <strong>Kanye West.</strong></p><p>That’s not all because Taylor has also worked with superstars like <strong>Usher,</strong> <strong>Chris Brown,</strong> and <strong>Omarion</strong> as a songwriter.</p><p>Besides that, Teyana also stars in the VH1 reality TV show Teyana and Iman. And, if that wasn’t enough, Iman’s wife has also done many high-profile fashion shows.</p><p>Furthermore, Iman has also appeared in several of Teyana’s music videos while he even put up his verse on the song.&nbsp;</p><h2>Iman Shumpert Wife: Age, Body Measurements & Nationality</h2><p>Talking about Taylor’s age, she is calculate_years datestring=”12/10/1990″] years old&nbsp;currently.

Iman Shumpert Wife & Kids</h2><p>Although Taylor is hugely successful herself, no doubt being married to an NBA star like Shumpert helps garner publicity. The two lovebirds got married in 2016 after dating for a while.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Teyana-And-Iman.jpg><p>Together, they have two kids, <strong>Iman Tayla Shumpert Jr. and Rue Rose Shumpert.</strong>&nbsp;Interestingly, Iman Tayla was born before the duo tied the knot on December 16, 2015. However, Iman is not Teyana’s first crush.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Shumpert’s wife had been involved in very high-profile relationships with A-list celebrities before meeting her baby father. For instance, back in 2008, Teyana was linked with another basketball player,<a href=# rel=noopener> <strong>Daniel Gibson</strong></a>.</p><p>Likewise, the duo dated for a year before breaking it off in 2009. Then, Taylor dated Canadian rapper Drake from May to June of 2009. Thereafter, she dated another rapper, Soulja Boy, until October of the same year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/teyana-taylor-iman-shumpert-skims-kids-embed1.webp><p>However, it doesn’t just end there because Iman’s wife was involved in a serious relationship with another NBA star, <strong>Brandon Jennings</strong>. Moreover, the couple dated for years, during which they even got engaged.</p><p>But luckily for Iman, the two separated in 2014. Since then, Teyana has ended her merry-go-round and stayed put with her current beau, Shumpert. And judging by their social media posts, we think that this might be Taylor’s last relationship.</p><h3>Upcoming Reality Show</h3><p>The duo, Nets free agent Iman, and his wife, Teyana, are set to appear in a reality television series this year.
