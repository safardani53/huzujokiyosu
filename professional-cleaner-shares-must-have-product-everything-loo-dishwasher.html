The price is around £1.50 to £2.&nbsp;</p><p>“Both of these are antibacterial so give me that added confidence when cleaning and a little goes a long way, so a bottle does last ages.”</p><p>Lynsey revealed washing up liquid can be used to clean everything so it is a great all-around, all-purpose cleaner.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealing her top cleaning advice, Lynsey encouraged people to just buy what they need, rather than having cupboards full of products.&nbsp;</p><p>She said it is best to work against the clock and do little and often cleaning to keep on top of things.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>She added: “Antibacterial washing up liquid cleans everything, you can even clean your car with it!&nbsp;</p><p>“Diluted, it makes a good all-around all-purpose clean for all around the home and it is also great for carpet and clothing stains used neat and left to sit for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is also not too harsh on your hands, so you don’t have to wear rubber gloves if you don’t want to.</p><p>“Also, safe to use around children and pets plus it won’t cause any damage.”</p><p>Other than antibacterial washing up liquid, cleaning expert Lynsey revealed she uses lots of other products around the home.&nbsp;</p><p>The TV cleaning star, who recently released her book Queen of Clean - The 15-Minute Clean: The quickest way to a sparkling home, said white vinegar is another great cleaning product.</p><p>White vinegar is also a great natural descaler for kettles and coffee machines as it removes hard watermarks, limescale and mould patches.</p><p>Lynsey added: “I like Mr Sheen mist spray as well as this is a great polish for furniture and glass, and leaves a great shine, smells amazing and you don’t need much!&nbsp;</p><p>“Nana’s Secret is another good product. The natural cleaning clay cleans, polishes, and leaves a protective film.&nbsp;</p><p>“It comes with a sponge that you keep in the product tub and smells of lemons! I love to use this to clean up my sinks.&nbsp;</p><p>“Lifebuoy antibacterial wipes are also great; these are biodegradable and eco-friendly but are great for quick toilet cleans and are great to have in your handbag for when out and about, for wiping coffee tables and trollies.”&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere the cleaning expert referred to Bona Tile’s stone and laminate cleaner as one of her favourite products for the home.&nbsp;</p><p>She described it as a great floor cleaner that leaves floors streak-free, antibacterial, and you don’t need to use much.</p><p>It also has no smell and leaves tiles really shiny.&nbsp;</p><p>Cleaning expert Lynsey also revealed her top three cleaning tips for bathrooms, kitchens and bedrooms to ensure you keep a clean home.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “In the bathroom, keep a squeegee in your shower so when you get out, you can quickly remove the water from your shower door and tiles, this will stop hard water and limescale build-up, saving you that tough clean.&nbsp;</p><p>“In the kitchen, if you use any lemons in your cooking don’t chuck them away.&nbsp;</p><p>Antibacterial washing up liquid is my top must-have product, you can clean literally everything in your home with a good washing up liquid!</p><span class=quote-credit>Lynsey Crombie,</span><p>“Use the left-over lemon to clean, great for cleaning up chopping boards with salt and great for popping on the end of your tap to remove limescale.&nbsp;</p><p>“For the bedroom, always air the bed in the morning. Pull back the sheets, open the window and let it air.</p><p>“A fresh-smelling bed will stop nasty odours and don’t store stuff under your bed as this collects dust.”</p><p>The cleaning expert also revealed her top cheap cleaning hacks to make cleaning easier and quicker without splurging on pricey products.&nbsp;</p><p>Her first tip is to mix a squirt of washing up liquid with 20ml of white vinegar into a bottle with water.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She said this makes a cheap powerful cleaning product.&nbsp;</p><p>Lynsey’s book Queen of Clean - The 15-Minute Clean: The quickest way to a sparkling home is available on <a href=#>Amazon</a> .</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">LYNSEY’S QUICK AND CHEAP CLEANING HACKS</h3></p><ul><li>Use denture tablets to clean the toilet instead of bleach.
