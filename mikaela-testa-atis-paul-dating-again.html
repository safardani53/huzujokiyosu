On Tuesday, March 14, 2023, Paul shared some snaps from his paid partnership with jewelry brand Bulgari.</p><p>Fans were impressed with Paul’s looks in those pictures, but another person also liked his photos very much. And it was none other than Testa who even took to the comment section to leave a cheeky comment reading, “Looking fine asf.”</p><p>Paul also didn’t take much time to reply to his ex-girlfriend’s comment, and around an hour later, he <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp1WL1nLpWm/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a>, “*blushes*.” And it was all that the fans of Testa and Paul needed to ignite the dating rumors. Besides, one fan even commented, “Marry her!”</p><p>However, this wasn’t the only social media interaction the former lovers had over the past few days. As many might already know, Testa and Paul still follow each other on Instagram. But, there weren’t many interactions, such as liking each other’s posts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mikaela-Testa-Atis-Paul-comment-Instagram.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Mikaela Testa’s comment and Atis Paul’s reply on Atis’ Instagram post (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>Nonetheless, those interactions have started to increase. For instance, Testa liked Paul’s Instagram post of February 4, 2023, where he <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CoO75bkhZX0/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> pictures of himself, his pet, and his sister Anna Paul. “I love my home,” he wrote in his caption.</p><p>Similarly, Paul has liked two of Testa’s Instagram posts. The first was three days ago, on March 13, 2023, when Testa <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CptgBkyJTcy/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> some snaps from her vacation in Dubai. The second one was on March 14, when she shared pictures of herself riding a quad bike in the desert.</p><p>Another thing that has made people think Testa and Paul are dating again is due to Testa’s previous statement where she mentioned that she is very much obsessed with her now ex-boyfriend.</p><p>With all this being said, one thing still remains to be cleared. Are Testa and Paul back together? Fans of the two believe that something might be going on between the two exes, but nothing has been made official as of this writing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>There is also the slight possibility that Testa and Paul aren’t dating again and might only have rekindled their friendship. Likewise, when they ended their relationship, Testa blamed Paul for ending their togetherness.</p><p>Due to that, some fans aren’t entirely happy to see that Testa and Paul have sparked romance rumors. One fan even wrote, “The audacity after that s—t talking video you posted. Get out,” with another one adding, “Didn’t you talk mad crap about him on TikTok?”</p><p>These are the same fans that are believing that Paul would be mad enough to rekindle his romantic relationship with Testa after everything she had done following their split.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mikaela-Testa-Atis-Paul.webp><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Mikaela Testa with her ex-boyfriend, Atis Paul, while they were still together (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>However, they make the ultimate decision, so their fans must wait and see where this goes. And until that happens, it’s better to say that Testa and Paul aren’t dating again. They might have reconnected, but it’s unknown if it’s romantically or not.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mikaela Testa and Atis Paul’s brief relationship details</h2><p>Testa and Paul met while they were still with their respective partners. They ultimately cheated on their partners to be with each other and made their relationship official sometime around 2019.</p><p>Their relationship became firm as time passed, and fans began seeing the couple in different places. They often flaunted cute pictures alongside each other on their social media handles, which the fans also loved to see more of.</p><p>However, there were differences in their relationship, which they managed to hide from the outside world until they officially called it quits in May 2022. Testa and Paul publicly announced their breakup in June 2022, initially calling it a mutual decision.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>But things started to get heated when Testa came forward on her TikTok handle, claiming Paul was the one who ended their relationship. She even <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11860619/OnlyFans-star-Mikaela-Testa-sparks-rumours-shes-ex-boyfriend-Atis-Paul.html rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned unsuccessfully trying</a> to end things with him many times.</p><p>She said, “You probably already know, but my boyfriend left me. And I was trying to leave him every single month for the past two years. And one day I was like, ‘This is it,’ and he never let me back, you guys.”</p><p>Testa had even accused Paul of stealing around 50% of her OnlyFans income. Furthermore, she had claimed that she and Paul would never be together again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57xLGapa2jnsOme8yiopqdnJZ6tbHSrZhmmaSewG68wK6jZpyRqbavs4yanpqhnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiger-woods-son-charlie-fist-bump-2022-pnc-championship-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tiger Woods &amp;amp; Son Charlie Fist Bump At 2022 PNC Championship: Photo Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-priscilla-presley-riley-keough-fight-over-lisa-maries-trust.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Priscilla Presley and Riley Keough's Fight Over Lisa Marie's Trust</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
