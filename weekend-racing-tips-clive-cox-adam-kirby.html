entries for top sprinter DILIGENT HARRY on Saturday and I'll be backing the trainer's judgement when it comes to choosing between five and six furlongs for his rising star sprinter.</p><p>Derby-winning pilot Adam Kirby will be watching Will Buick ride his Epsom hero Adayar at Longchamp on Sunday but Cox's stable jockey will be back on the home beat in Berkshire with Diligent Harry ready to win whichever race he's asked to contest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/GettyImages-1310448045.jpg><p>Cox has to choose between the Listed Rous Stakes over five furlongs at 2.05 or the Group 3 Bengough Stakes over a furlong further, and Diligent Harry can prove he's every bit as good on turf as the all-weather after chasing home Happy Romance on grass at Newbury in July.</p><p><strong>GOLD BET</strong></p><p><strong>PIERRE LAPIN</strong> was switched from Roger Varian to Ado McGuinness in the summer and the 2019 Mill Reef Stakes winner could be back winning in Britain in Ascot's 3.50 on Saturday.</p><p>The four-year-old was down the field in the Commonwealth Cup here as a three-year-old but he looks exceptionally well handicapped on his juvenile form and the rarely out of form McGuinness looks to have found a perfect opening at his preferred seven furlongs.</p><p><strong>SILVER BET</strong></p><p>Ryan Moore will be one of the busiest jockeys at Longchamp this weekend but the Coolmore number one teams up with his dad Gary at Ascot on Friday and the pair can land the 4.15 with <strong>ROYAUME UNI</strong>.</p><p>The four-year-old's handicap mark has to involve a fair bit of guesswork after a campaign of novices' handicap hurdles under Ryan's brothers Josh and Jamie, but he did win an all-weather handicap at Lingfield off 79 back in February.</p><p>An 8lbs rise for that four and a half lengths success doesn't seem overly harsh given his hurdles efforts in the meantime and his winning soft ground form in France augurs well if the forecast rains turn the Ascot terrain softer than the currently expected good.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p><strong>BRONZE BET</strong></p><p>The second horse I'm interested in at Ascot on Friday is the Michael Dods' raider <strong>WOVEN </strong>which will be sporting cheekpieces for the first time in the last race at 4.50 with Connor Beasley in the saddle.</p><p>Woven never really got competitive in the Ayr Silver Cup won by Staxton but he ran his usual solid race and he's back at seven furlongs tomorrow for just the second time since winning at Meydan for David Simcock in February 2020.</p><p>The handicapper's been slow to relent but a one pound drop for Ayr and the step back up in trip with the new headgear looks an ideal time to get involved with a horse which has been running consistently well all season.</p><p>Frankie Dettori will be back from Thursday's charity jaunt to Bellewstown to ride top-weight Sunray Major for the Gosdens, but Dods doesn't tend to waste his journeys south and the likely each-way price about Woven is a major bonus.</p><p>Keith Dalgleish continues to churn out winners up and down the country and the Carluke yard can notch another success at Newcastle on Friday night with <strong>SOAPY'S SISTER</strong> in the 8.30.</p><p>The three-year-old returns after a month off with cheekpieces fitted for the first time and regular pilot Sam James should find himself riding a fresh filly set to add to her wins at Hamilton and Ayr this season.</p><p><h3
