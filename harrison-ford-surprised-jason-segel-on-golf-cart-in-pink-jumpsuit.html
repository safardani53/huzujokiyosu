Like, what are you wearing?’ Because Harrison’s kinda like, he’s a traditionalist, he is an older guy. He’s got great style, but he was just like, ‘Why are you wearing [that]?’”</p><p><a href=#>Harrison Ford Through the Years&nbsp;</a></p><p>To surprise both Ford, 80, and Segel, 43, director <strong>Randall Keenan Winston</strong> asked Fanger if she could find a matching outfit for the Star Wars actor.</p><p>“Because Harrison’s reaction to Jason and the jumpsuits was so funny, Randall came up to me and he was like, ‘Can you get one for Harrison?’ And I was like, ‘What? OK,'” she recalled. “So then Harrison walked by me, I was like, ‘Harrison, you want one of those?’ And he goes, ‘Can you get it in pink?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Harrison-Ford-Drove-Golf-Cart-in-Pink-Jumpsuit-to-Surprise-Jason-Sege.jpg><p>Fanger went on to do just that — without Segel knowing.</p><p>“We got one and we dyed it pink. And then I put it in his trailer one morning with a tag on it that said, ‘This is your costume for today.’ I just put it in there and then he came out with it on. He was all excited,” Fanger told Us. “And then got in his golf cart.”</p><p>According to Fanger, <a href=#>Ford “would always drive around in his golf cart.”</a> And on this day, he sped away to find where Segel and costar <a href=#><strong>Michael Urie</strong></a> were filming.</p><p>“Crazy driving all over,” she joked. “And I was like, ‘They’re over here.’ So we went over to where they were shooting and he just waited for Jason. Jason and Michael were doing a scene where they were walking out of a building. And so Harrison just went out and stood leaning next to a pole, a pillar or whatever. So that when Jason and Michael came out, they just saw him standing there in his pink jumpsuit.”</p><p><a href=#>TV Shows Renewed and Canceled in 2023</a></p><p>Naturally, the prank was a hit. “[Jason] started dying laughing and then Harrison pretended to pull it off and drove away in his golf cart,” she noted. “It was pretty early on [in production].”</p><p>The Windfall actor told his own version of the story during an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on January 24.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Harrison-Ford-Drove-Golf-Cart-in-Pink-Jumpsuit-to-Surprise-Jason-Segel-on-Set-2.jpg><p>“You change in wardrobe pretty fast. I was wasting a lot of time picking out outfits because I like to look good. And so I decided I was going to start wearing jumpsuits to work. You know, like a real tradesman. But I was kind of chicken about it so I decided I would get there 30 minutes before work so no one would see me. I had to get used to it,” Segel explained at the time. “So I showed up and Harrison Ford was waiting outside my trailer to run lines. He kept eyeing my jumpsuit. I saw it happening. He was side-eying me. And then I said, ‘You looking at my jumpsuit Harrison?’ And he said, ‘I sure am kid.’ And I felt really embarrassed, like I had been a little emasculated or something by Harrison Ford.”</p><p>But by the next day, Ford was in his hot pink jumpsuit and the two posed for a photo together. “He was like, ‘You and me, we are in this together,'” Segel recalled. “So now we are best friends.”</p><p><a href=#>‘Freaks and Geeks’ Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></p><p>The sweet moment led to the perfect wrap gift for the cast and crew: jumpsuits for all.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You know Harrison Ford’s character? Paul says ‘woof,'” Fanger told Us. “We got a little gas station [patch], like a little oval where a name tag is on a guest. Like a boiler suit. And it said ‘woof.'”</p><p>Shrinking, which has officially been renewed for season 2, also stars <strong>Jessica Williams</strong>,<strong> Lukita Maxwell</strong>, <strong>Christa Miller</strong>, <strong>Luke Tennie</strong>, <strong>Ted McGinley</strong> and <strong>Devin Kawaoka</strong>.
