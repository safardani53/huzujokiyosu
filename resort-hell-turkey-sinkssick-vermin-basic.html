Everything looked <span id=843f2d19-405a-4c11-b2b5-d0feda725c71 class=suggested-link>nice</span> and I thought to myself, ‘wow’.</p><p>“But we arrived and it looked completely different.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>“The first thing we noticed was the shower head missing from our bathroom.</p><p>“Then the staff told us they were still working on building the hotel.”</p><p>Shocking photos reveal broken gutters, crumpled sun loungers, and piles of building materials and boxes littered across the hotel.</p><p>And while the hotel website guarantees four different <a href=#>swimming</a> pools, Maxwell discovered many of the facilities promised were simply non-existent.</p><p>The disappointed dad said: “It was an absolute disaster.</p><p>"The hotel should have been knocked down to two stars - obviously they’d overcharged us.</p><p>"The holiday was just never <span id=a709f9b0-4154-45e3-b0d5-f3926362f27e class=suggested-link>the holiday</span> they’d sold us."</p><p>Maxwell accused the hotel of serving up grub covered in flies - landing him and Kieran with dodgy bellies.</p><p>Despite paying for the all-inclusive package, the desperate dad rang his travel agent and asked for help getting <a href=#>transport</a> into town to eat elsewhere.</p><p>But when he turned up at the restaurant they’d arranged, he got scammed by racking up a £100 bill - for a basic slap-up meal for him and his kid.</p><p>Maxwell said: “It was a joke. Things just started getting worse and worse.</p><p>“Back at the hotel, there were a bunch of other Brits. One lady got everyone’s email to make a complaint but nothing happened.</p><p>“We’d been promised free wifi throughout the hotel and in our rooms - but when we arrived, we were told we’d have to pay an extra fee if we wanted it.</p><p>“The only place you could use it was at reception. So everyone had to just sit around in the lobby to access the internet.”</p><p>Ever since the nightmare getaway in July 2022, Maxwell has been emailing his travel agency to complain.</p><p>But he claims he and other hotel guests, who have demanded the hotel or their travel agents cough up compensation after the <span id=2c2b1e97-d7af-467a-9092-df69510ff7ff class=suggested-link>horror</span> experience, feel they haven't been properly listened to.</p><p>Hazel Caffrey, a 35-year-old teacher from Cheshire, met Maxwell at the Xafira while on holiday with her five-year-old daughter.</p><p>She confirmed the experience was "absolutely diabolical."</p><p>Hazel said: "It was the first holiday we'd had since lockdown.</p><p>"We booked this five-star experience thinking we wouldn't have to leave the hotel for anything.</p><p>"Instead, the indoor pool wasn't open. There was mess everywhere - planks of wood and building stuff, so it was a hazard for children."</p><p>Hazel said her daughter, who has a dairy allergy, was unable to eat any of the limited selection of hotel food.</p><p>She continued: "The food was disgraceful and there was nothing there for my daughter to eat.</p><p>"We were there for a week and went out for excursions every day just to get out the hotel.</p><p>"And the smell of the hotel was vile - it smelt like a zoo or a wet dog."</p><p>Hazel said she'd spent approximately £1,400 on the trip - and received only £200 in compensation for the ordeal.</p><p>Maxwell claimed to have received only a travel voucher for him and Keiran, worth £100 each, "after complaining for a year".</p><p>Travel Center UK told The Sun: "We have addressed the passenger's concerns and provided them with a fully flexible voucher as a resolution.
