The fuzzy ballad is an intriguing cut from her debut album <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</a> and it happens to be her latest single.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But given its name and somewhat confusing lyrics, it might not make sense to everyone. Here's what Billie Eilish's "Xanny" really means, as far as we can tell, including commentary from the pop star herself for good measure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what does Billie Eilish's "Xanny" mean?</h2><p>The newest single from Billie's debut album is a little less straightforward than the other tunes you may have heard from her. Essentially, it's about Billie saying no to drugs in a roundabout way. The word "Xanny" refers to a Xanax, which is a popular drug when it comes to recreation, and happens to be widely used by all kinds of clientele, including young people around Billie's age.</p><p>In "Xanny," Billie is singing about how she doesn't need a Xanax, and doesn't want one to "feel better," now or ever.</p><p>"I'm in their secondhand smoke / Still just drinking canned Coke / I don't need a Xanny to feel better," the chorus proudly proclaims, as the bass swells up over Billie's voice. It's all about how lonely it can be when everyone's doing drugs around you, but you've chosen not to do so, because you're not a part of that world and don't want to be.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>"If you're just sitting in a room and you listen to this song, the chorus kind of, like, throws itself at you. Like 'I'm in their secondhand smoke,'" Billie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told MTV</a> about the song. "I just wanted it to sound the way that it feels to breathe in recycled breath. Recycled, poisonous breath, I may add. I just wanted it to feel miserable."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Billie's video for "Xanny" is equally enigmatic, as it opens with her sitting on a cream-colored bench clad in a matching sweater and leggings. Everything looks pretty normal at first blush, but then you see it around 35 seconds in, when someone appears to put out their cigarette on her cheek.&nbsp;</p><p>While figuring out exactly what Billie meant by this video that may make viewers squeamish is harder than analyzing the lyrics, it's easy to see Billie feels like she's being abused or hurt by others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The video continues with Billie having more cigarettes put out on her face, further reinforcing the fact that she feels like she's alone in a sea of smokers and "xanny" users, and it's causing her physical and emotional pain. Judging by her twisted-up face, it's clear that she's suffering alone and wants all of it to come to a stop, but that's easier said than done if everyone is doing the same thing.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, Billie has crafted a relatable tune about the power of peer pressure when it comes to drugs and smoking, and she's made it abundantly clear that she doesn't wish to be a part of it.&nbsp;</p><p>It truly comes to live with her visceral music video, and you know Billie – she's going to make whatever point she wants to make, no matter how in your face it is.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7atuMieZJ6hnJ7AqXnXmqWnsV2isqK6yKee</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./skyler-timothy-joness-girlfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Skyler Timothy Jones Dating Skyler Timothy Jones's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fuudyis7isrosijcfrgzpzaftax5gaqt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch NCIS Season 9 Episode 5: Safe Harbor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
