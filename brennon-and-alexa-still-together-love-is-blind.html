And for <a href=#>Season 3</a>, that was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brennon Lemieux</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexa Alfia</a>. They fell for each other quickly, and when they met, they were both ecstatic to see the person they fell for from their respective sides of a wall.</p><p>So, are Brennon and Alexa still together after Love Is Blind? Season 1's Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed and Matt Barnett and Amber Pike are still together. Will Alexa and Brennon join the ranks of Love Is Blind success stories?</p><p>Judging by the After the Altar special, fans will be pleased!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Brennon and Alexa still together after 'Love Is Blind'?</h2><p>Most Love Is Blind fans agree that Alexa and Brennon were locked in at the conclusion of the Season 3 reunion. Now that the After the Altar special has been released, fans will be happy to learn that the Lemieuxs are solid!</p><p>In fact, the couple may be the first to have a Love Is Blind baby! Brennon gifted Alexa with a baby onesie on After the Altar with the words "Baby Lemieux" inscribed on it!</p><p>Keep in mind, neither Lauren and Cameron nor Amber and Barnett have yet to reveal that they are becoming parents. And based on how Alexa and Brennon's relationship has developed, we believe that it's only a matter of time before there's a bun in the oven.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alexa Lemieux (@mrsalexalemieux)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brennon and Alexa's love was apparent early on in Season 3 of 'Love Is Blind.'</h2><p>Even though Alexa and Brennon got engaged after just a week or so of getting to know each other in the pods, it was hard to deny their chemistry. They took an immediate liking to each other and they were both smitten well before they even met.</p><p>Alexa said they decided together not to give each other clues about what they look like in order to keep the "blind" aspect of the experiment pure.</p><p>But when they met face to face, Alexa and Brennon were both overjoyed to see what the other looked like. And the first hurdle was behind them.</p><p>Prior to the Season 3 reunion, viewers had a few clues about where they stood, outside of Love Is Blind. While both of them had done a great job of keeping things off social media after filming, there were multiple photos on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexa's Instagram</a> that clearly show her left ring finger bare.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brennon Lemieux (@brennonlemieux)</a></p></figure><p>Although there were posts where Alexa is seated across from someone in a restaurant, there weren't any posts on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brennon's Instagram</a> that mirror them. There was also a trip to Arizona that Alexa took with her friends, sans Brennon. And in posts and Instagram Reels, there was no hint of Brennon being there. He also couldn't be found in a video from her birthday outing in September 2022 that Alexa was tagged in.</p><p>Of course, we know now it was because they were keeping things on the hush-hush because of their NDAs after being on Love Is Blind.</p><p>We'd like to wish Alexa and Brennon all the best with their marriage!</p><p>Watch Love Is Blind Seasons 1–3 on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2Bmus2opWaZnpl6orjEsZhmq6Seua1506ienqyYmr9uuM6vnGaho2KvrbXNnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gavin-beasley-talks-about-the-hills-lauren-conrad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gavin Beasley Talks About The Hills, Lauren Conrad</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-good-doctor-guest-stars-season-6.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Good Doctor' Season 6 Brings Fresh Faces to the Medical Staff</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
