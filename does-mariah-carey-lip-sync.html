However, some weren't convinced that Mariah was actually singing the songs live during the show.</p><p>"They let Mariah Carey do this Christmas Special just to lip sync the whole time? Tf," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> one user on Twitter.</p><p>"This @MariahCarey #Christmas special ... not impressed #lipsync #notsogood," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chimed in</a> another.</p><p>So, what gives? Did Mariah actually sing her songs live during the 2022 Christmas special? Well, as of the time of writing, neither the singer nor her representation have commented on the accusations. However, some intrepid users online came quickly to Mariah's defense to point out that she did indeed perform all of her songs live.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I was at @MariahCarey's #MerryChristmasToAll concert at the 12/16 show. She was PERFECTION. I can 100% attest that she didn't lip-sync the hits medley like the haters say.

During the 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, some fans thought that Mariah wasn't actually singing live either.</p><p>"Can't sing, can’t dance, can’t even lip sync correctly. Mariah Carey is just an animatronic at this point," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> a user on Twitter, alongside a clip of Mariah performing at the parade.</p><p>In 2018, some listeners accused Mariah of lip-syncing during a performance at the AMAs.</p><p>"Just so we are clear Mariah Carey Is Lip Singing #AMAs," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> one user at the time.</p><p>Then again back in 2016, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mariah dealt with an on-stage flub when her in-ear monitor gave out during a New Year's performance and caused her to unintentionally reveal that she was lip-syncing.</p><p>Even if Mariah's 2022 Christmas performance was genuine, it has been made abundantly clear over the years that some fans can't seem to shake the belief that she isn't always singing live. With the artist hesitant to confirm or deny the rumors beyond the aforementioned 2016 admission, it seems as though only time (and the watchful eyes of fans) will tell if Mariah is actually belting out her classic tracks when she performs or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ymmKuhkZ16pK3RnrBmpJmlerTFzZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eliza-scanlen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eliza Scanlen Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anderson-cooper-siblings-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anderson Coopers Relationship with His Siblings Made Him Who He Is Today</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
