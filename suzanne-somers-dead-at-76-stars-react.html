I love you @suzannesomers. I’ll never forget your positive loving outlook on life. Your sweet heart and gentle spirit! Rest, dance, smile in paradise…”</p><p>In Somer’s memory, Cohen, 55, posted an old photo of them together on his Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen show, with several red heart emojis.</p><p><a href=#>Us Weekly </a>confirmed that Somers died on Sunday, October 15, following a battle with breast cancer. She was 76.</p><p>“Suzanne Somers passed away peacefully at home in the early morning hours of October 15th. She survived an aggressive form of breast cancer for over 23 years,” the actress’ longtime publicist, <strong>R. Couri Hay</strong>, told Us in a statement. “Suzanne was surrounded by her loving husband Alan, her son Bruce, and her immediate family.”</p><p>The statement noted that Somers’ 77th birthday would have been on Monday, October 16 and that the family plans to “celebrate her extraordinary life.”</p><p>“[They] want to thank her millions of fans and followers who loved her dearly,” the statement concluded. “A private family burial will take place this week, with a memorial to follow next month.”</p><p>Somers’ husband, <strong>Alan Hamel</strong>, told Page Six earlier this year that her cancer had returned. (She had previously been diagnosed with skin cancer in her 30s before having breast cancer beginning in 2000.)</p><p>Kardashian and Cohen were two of several celebrities who took to social media to honor Somers, who was known for starring in Three’s Company, Step by Step and She’s the Sheriff.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Caitlyn Jenner</strong></a> mourned the loss of her Battle of the Network Stars cohost via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, posting a picture of them smiling and laughing.</p><p>“We lost a true American Icon today. @suzannesomers you will be missed.

Rest in Peace,” she captioned the post.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong></a>, who called the news “tragic,” took to her Instagram Story to share a video message about the “tremendous loss.”</p><p>“I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know her,” she said. “She is a force, she is groundbreaking, she is love. She was married to her soulmate, best friend, they were inseparable. She’s a family person, she’s about research and fighting for what she believes in when that takes tremendous courage and it’s not popular. Wow, I really, really, really had so much respect for her…what a wonderful person. I’m so so sorry. Sorry to Suzanne’s family.”</p><p>Alongside a broken heart emoji, <a href=#><strong>Olivia Munn</strong></a> reshared an Instagram post to her Story of a black and white photo of Somers.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Viola Davis</strong></a> posted a video tribute to her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, with the caption: “RIP Suzanne Somers. I grew up watching Three’s Company. You were a joy and forever young. Rest well ❤🕊🙏🏿.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jeremy Renner</strong></a> reshared an Instagram post of Somers with the text “RIP” and the folded hands emoji.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Barry Manilow</strong></a> shared a heartfelt tribute via <a href=# rel=noopener>X</a>: “Suzanne and I were friends for decades. She was the sister I never had and my close confidant forever. We shared triumphs and heartaches. Her fame in so many fields overshadowed her real talent as one of our greatest comedic actors, a loving mother, an amazing homemaker, and one of the world’s best cooks. I will miss her dearly and hope that she is now out of pain and at peace.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasraqWu6%2BxjKympp2iqHqlscCdZJqsXWyDbr%2FTmqmsZaKarqTAjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashley-tisdale-and-jared-murillo-still-together.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ashley Tisdale and Jared Murillo: Still Together!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miles-morales-faces-off-against-a-multiverse-of-spider-people-in-across-the-spider-verse-trailer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miles Morales Returns to Multiverse in Across the Spider-Verse Trailer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
