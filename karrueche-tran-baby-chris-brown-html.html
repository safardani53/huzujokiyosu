No baby drama for me," she tweeted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On the other hand, the tabloid reported the singer was happy about being a father. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Sometime later, Brown&nbsp;took responsibility for his daughter, born on May 27, 2014, and even <a href=# rel=follow>fought for her custody</a>.</p><h2>Karrueche Tran Was 'Completely Mortified' by Baby News</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The baby news definitely came as a shock for both&nbsp;Tran and Brown, as even the singer found out about the child after her birth.</p><p>But as for Tran, the news was a hard pill to swallow.
