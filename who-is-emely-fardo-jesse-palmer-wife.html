I'm head over heels for her," he told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a> after their engagement. In 2020, the pair said "I do" during an intimate ceremony after postponing their original wedding plans due to the pandemic.

"We were only able to invite a small group of close friends that live in the greater N.Y.C. area and that were in quarantine at the time," they told PEOPLE.
