girlfriend <a href=#>Julia</a>, 31, as the two engaged in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">intimate tongue kiss</a> during Paris Fashion Week.</p><p>In the picture, the Donda rapper wore a sweatshirt and leather jacket as he opened his mouth wide to smooch the actress.</p><p>The Uncut Gems star returned the favor while wearing a bright red one-shoulder dress, thick black eyeliner and her hair in a bun.</p><p>She finished off the look with over-the-knee silver boots and a black trench coat.</p><h2>REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR</h2><p>However, this wasn't the first time Kanye shared a similar photo, setting the tread with both his ex <a href=#>Kim</a>, 41, and also Amber Rose, 38.</p><p>In May of 2015, the co-parents snapped a tongue-kissing moment while sharing an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">intimate moment in a photo booth.</a></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>The Yeezy founder wore a black and white tuxedo with a bow tie, as the reality star donned a sparkly dress for the formal occasion.</p><p>In the sexy image, the two kissed while locking eyes.</p><p>Prior to his marriage, Kanye dated model Amber between 2008 and 2010, also sharing the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">same exact sort of peck.</a></p><p>In yet another throwback photo, the father of four wore a blue jean shirt while his ex-TV personality looked gorgeous in a nude-colored dress.</p><p>The pair shared the same exact kiss in the image, as the musician has consistently repeated history with the photo theme.</p><h2>NOT ALL FANS</h2><p>However, not all have been supportive of Kanye's repetitive posting, and broadcaster <a href=#>Piers Morgan recently branded the snap as "cringe."</a></p><p>The smitten couple has been inseparable in recent weeks with a series of loved-up displays and celebrity parties.</p><p>But their latest public PDA proved too much for Piers and made him feel nauseous.</p><p>Sharing the kiss snap on Twitter, he added: "These two are so cringe. [vomit emoji]."</p><h2>CITY OF LOVE</h2><p>High-profile couple Kanye and Julia were in a gothic mood in the French capital over the weekend with the singer wearing spooky contact lenses and lots of black leather.</p><p>The mother of one has been said to be a fan of Kanye's latest track Eazy, despite him hitting out at ex Kim and her new man Pete Davidson.</p><p>The diss track, in which Kanye refers to Julia as a "bad b***h", sees the controversial artist take aim at Kim's mothering skills as well as stating he'll beat comedian Pete's "a**".</p><p>The ex Presidential candidate was recently left fuming when&nbsp;<a href=#>the KKW Beauty founder kissed the comedian&nbsp;</a>in front of him while filming SNL.</p><h2>MOVING ON</h2><p>While he still seems hung up on his ex, <a href=#>Ye has spared no expense on his new girlfriend</a> in the short time they've been together.</p><p>He has continuously showered her with new clothes as they whisk away on romantic dates.</p><p>Julia told Interview Magazine of their relationship: "For someone like me who's such a control freak and always so used to taking care of myself, to just let go and be taken care of is foreign at this point in life.</p><p>"I've been the primary caretaker of everyone for so long, so it's a new sensation, but honestly, I think I deserve it."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Kim filed for divorce from Kanye in February of 2021 after a string of public outbursts and bizarre behavior.</p><p>The former couple share four kids together: North, eight, Saint, six, Chicago, three, and Psalm, two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707114681-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000676475525-11.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsZWx%2FdYGXaKKapqmaerix0q1kq6GgpbKledOopaCtlWLBsMHCoaCnn12ltbDAzmahrqSZlnqstcxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicole-curtis-shows-off-fit-physique-in-swimsuit-selfie-with-son-this-will-never-be-seen-again.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicole Curtis's Bathing Suit Selfie with Son Harper</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-consani.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Alex Consani net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
