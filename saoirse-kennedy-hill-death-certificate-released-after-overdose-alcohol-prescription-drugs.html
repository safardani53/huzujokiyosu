Saoirse and her friend Sinead, with whom she had spent her evening out, went to bed in the room usually claimed by Saoirse’s uncle Douglas. No one went to disturb them as noon came and went because they knew how late the pair had been out, a family friend previously told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When they finally went up” they found her unresponsive, the friend said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Saorise was set to return to Boston College for her final year in late August.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her uncle <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>posted his eulogy for her</a> — a joyous, mournful remembrance of a young woman no less exuberant for her own struggles — in full online. Of the service, the Kennedy friend told PEOPLE, “There were a lot of tears.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Saoirse’s mother, Courtney, did not speak; her father, Paul, said his daughter “was the love of my life” before he broke down in tears, according to the family friend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She was a rebel,” Paul said of Saoirse, “and I loved her to death.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tim Shriver, Courtney’s cousin, also gave a eulogy and described Saoirse <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>as “the daughter of two beautiful parents and dozens more mothers and fathers eager to have her.”</a> (Like Robert, he shared his eulogy online.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She was an only child with a hundred brothers and sisters,” said Shriver, who is the chairman of the <a title="(opens new window)" href=#>Special Olympics</a>, founded by his mother, Eunice Shriver.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If anybody ever wondered whether God loves the Kennedys, the proof is that he gave us Saoirse, this brilliant beam of light and laughter,” Robert said in his eulogy. “Now, it’s time for us to cease being sad at her passing and to practice being grateful that we had her for 22 amazing years.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Instagram</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Saoirse Kennedy Hill (right) moving into Boston College.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Robert Kennedy Jr./Instagram</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>RELATED VIDEO: Saoirse Kennedy Hill’s Father Paul Overcame His Fears to Pay Tribute to His Late Daughter</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since her death, many who knew Saoirse have spoken of her <a title="(opens new window)" href=#>brightness and warmth</a> and also her drive — what in other Kennedys has pushed them to be politicians and public servants. Saoirse, too, was politically and socially minded, with an activist streak. She saw the world and what could change in it; and she could be as discerning about herself. She spoke candidly about her mental health and time in treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My depression took root in the beginning of my middle school years and will be with me for the rest of my life,” she wrote<a title="(opens new window)" href=#> in a 2016 piece</a> for the student newspaper at her private school, the elite Deerfield Academy. “Although I was mostly a happy child, I suffered bouts of deep sadness that felt like a heavy boulder on my chest.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like her daughter, Courtney had also grappled with depression, saying in <a href=# title="(opens new window)" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a May radio interview</a>, “I’ve gone in and out … my whole life. So all of you out there who suffer from depression, you’re not alone. And you can get through it, as difficult as it is.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Saoirse spoke out in 2016 after returning to Deerfield to encourage others in helping her dismantle the stigma around mental health.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“People talk about cancer freely; why is it so difficult to discuss the effects of depression, [bipolar], anxiety, or schizophrenic disorders?” she wrote. “Just because the illness may not be outwardly visible doesn’t mean the person suffering from it isn’t struggling.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Let’s come together to make our community more inclusive and comfortable,” she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At Saoirse’s funeral, Shriver described how the family celebrated her last birthday, in May. Saoirse had asked to have dinner outside, under the summer sky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“And at one point, the conversation turned to that birthday talk: What does it feel like and what do you remember from your last year and that kind of thing,” Shriver said. “And then I asked [Saoirse] a slightly different question: ‘What do you want to learn in your 22nd year?’</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Without a second’s pause, she answered: ‘I want to learn to love myself.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>• With reporting by JENNIFER LYNCH</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CkuarAyJyqaKuRpLazv8Rmop6mnpqxunnHoqOlZZSarrW0jJycq6yZm7akrdOeZKudnJqutLHDZpifrJWnerDCxKubqKuVYq6tr86hpqVloKeytK%2FRoqetoZ%2BjeqW%2B1KCqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-tiarra-monet-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Tiarra Monet Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jodie-sweetin-addiction-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Full House Star Jodie Sweetin Talks about Her Addiction and Getting Sober</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
