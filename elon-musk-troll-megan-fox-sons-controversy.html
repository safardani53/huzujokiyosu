A number of people commented about Megan and her recent comments clapping back at Robby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elon-musk-mock-megan-fox-kids-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Megan clapped back at a tweet from Robby where he shared a photo of her and her three sons, where he claimed to have seen two of them “have a full on breakdown saying they were forced by their mom to wear girls clothes [sic].” He also accused her of “child abuse,” after sharing the alleged anecdote. The Jennifer’s Body&nbsp;actress called out the director and former candidate saying that he was simply “looking for attention” and accused him of being a “clout chaser.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Megan explained that it was disturbing that he would make an unprompted attack against her&nbsp; kids. “Irregardless of how desperate you may become at any given time to acquire wealth, power, success, or fame – never use children as leverage or social currency. Especially under malevolent and erroneous pretense,” she wrote. “Exploiting my child’s gender identity to gain attention in your political campaign has put you on the wrong side of the universe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elon-musk-mock-megan-fox-kids-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The actress continued and called herself a witch, when telling Robby that he shouldn’t mess with her. “I have been burned at the stake by insecure, narcissistic, impotent, little men like you many times,” she wrote. “You f**ked with the wrong witch.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Megan</a> later joked about having a “carcass-eating ritual” outside the former Republican politician’s home on her Instagram Story. Robby responded in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>comment</a> by denying that he had a political campaign (though he did run as a write-in candidate in 2022, and his campaign <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a> still shows up in a Google search for his name), and he said that he believed “that what I witnessed should never happen to a child.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Despite Robby’s claims, Megan has spoken about her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sons’ interest in fashion</a>, and she’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoken about bullying</a> that her eldest son&nbsp;<strong>Noah&nbsp;</strong>has endured for wearing dresses, which she has also said is his own choice. The actress vowed to always protect her children and wished that people wouldn’t be so cruel in an April interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>U.K. Glamour.</a>&nbsp;“I can’t control the way other people react to my children. I can’t control the things that other children – that they go to school with – have been taught and then repeat to them,” she said. “I’m so proud of my kids. Noah is an unbelievable pianist. He can learn Mozart’s concerto in an hour. I want people to see that, but I also don’t want the world to have access to this gentle soul and say all the things that we all know they’re going to say.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5BrZp6kn6N6rsHSpGStqp%2BhuW65xKCYp2WWpMVuv86nqmabn6PBs7vVnqmssV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./enjoy-some-of-tommy-coopers-best-gags-that-are-about-to-go-on-show-in-museum.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Enjoy some of Tommy Coopers best gags that are about to go on show in museum The Sun</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kamp-koral-meet-moop-s1-e7-paramount.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years: Kamp Koral | Meet Moop (S1, E7) | Paramount+</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
