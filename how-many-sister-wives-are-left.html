Because of Utah laws, Kody is only legally married to one woman, Robyn. He's in a spiritual marriage with the remaining three.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, even spiritual marriages can come with their issues. It would appear that Kody's full house is a bit lacking lately. How many sister wives are left and is there such a thing as a spiritual divorce?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many sister wives are left? Not many.</h2><p>You know the old adage last hired, first fired? Well, that doesn't apply to Kody's marriages because <a href=#>Robyn Brown</a> was the last wife he met, the only wife he legally married, and is the last wife standing. In fact, we witnessed their marriage during Season 1 of the show. Much of the friction between Robyn and the other three wives stems from the perceived preferential treatment of Robyn.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kody apparently saw Robyn more than the other three wives which he claims was because she never traveled. In a February 2021 conversation with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Online</a>, Kody shared that Robyn never had to quarantine so Kody was over there more often. He also said his time over there was "boring" because of his "small children." Sorry it isn't super fun raising your kids! Perhaps don't have 18 of them?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's going on with Kody Brown's spiritual wives?</h2><p>Meri, Christine, and Janelle Brown have all parted ways from Kody. Meri and Kody had already been separated for about five years and weren't sharing Meri's home. They "married" in 1990 and all was well until a 2015 catfishing scandal in which <a href=#>Meri fell for a man online</a> who turned out to be a woman. From that moment on, Kody became physically and romantically distant from her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Because of his trust issues with Meri, Kody has said on the show that they are well and truly over. If she wanted to marry someone else he would have no problem with that. In a December 2022 episode of Sister Wives: One-on-One, Meri revealed that her 32-year marriage was definitely over whether she wanted that or not. Kody made the decision.</p><p>Kody and his second wife Janelle "tied the knot" in January 1993 then untied it in 2022. For <a href=#>Janelle</a>, she felt as if she was put in the middle of Kody's divorce from his third wife Christine. Ultimately, Kody took some frustration out on the two older children he shared with Janelle. "It basically feels like I'm being forced to choose between my children and this group. I don't feel like my children are welcome," said Janelle in the Season 17 finale.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Speaking of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christine</a>, she's also out after a little more than a quarter century of marriage. She pulled the plug in November 2021 which tell us this pandemic was very revealing for the Brown brood.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a statement obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Online</a>, Christine said, "After more than 25 years together, Kody and I have grown apart and I have made the difficult decision to leave," she said. "We will continue to be a strong presence in each other's lives as we parent our beautiful children and support our wonderful family. At this time, we ask for your grace and kindness as we navigate through this stage within our family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Kody has no plans to add new wives to the mix but we'll believe that when we see it. In the meantime, we wish his exes well in their next journey. May they find joy, however it may look.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyapbJlo57AtbHRZq6irpWoeqK%2BxGajnp6k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jaime-cardriche.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jaime Cardriche</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./deborah-twiss.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Deborah Twiss Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
