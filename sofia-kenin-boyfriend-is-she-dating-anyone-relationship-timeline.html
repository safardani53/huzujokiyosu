The American tennis player, Kenin, was previously linked with tennis coach Max Wenders.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The 25-year-old grew up idolizing <a href=# rel=noopener>Serena Williams</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Maria Sharapova</a>, and in 2019 she defeated the former, causing upset worldwide.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sofia-kenin-australian-open.jpg><p>In 2020, Sofia took the tennis world by storm after she won the Australian Open at 21, becoming the youngest American woman to win a major singles title. A year prior, she won three WTA titles symbolizing what was coming next.&nbsp;</p><p>But the past two years haven’t been kind to the tennis prodigy. After reaching world no.4 in ranking, Sofia fell out of the top 200 in 2022. In 2023, Sofia looks ready to make a grand return to tennis.</p><p>At Wimbledon, Sofia has already caused a stir by knocking out <a href=# rel=noopener>Coco Gauff</a> in the first round. She will next face Chinese tennis player Wang Xinyu.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sofia Kenin Boyfriend: Is She Dating Anyone?</h2><p>Sofia Kenin doesn’t have a boyfriend and isn’t seeing anyone currently. After her break up with her former partner, Kenin seems focused on her tennis career.</p><p>Her social media handles do not give any hints about her dating life. She hasn’t shared any pictures with a mystery man, and all her latest posts are related to tennis tournaments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sofia-kenin-max-wenders.jpg><p>Earlier this year, Sofia had taken a trip to Dubai, but it looks like it was just a family trip with her dad, Alex Kenin. There is a chance that Sofia might be keeping her partner away from the spotlight.</p><p>But for now, the 2020 Australian Open Champion only wants her racquet to make noise. Previously, Sofia was dating Max Wenders, but that relationship fizzled out quickly.&nbsp;</p><h3>Who Is Max Wenders? Sofia Kenin Former Boyfriend&nbsp;</h3><p>Max Wenders is the former Dutch tennis coach and hitting partner for several players on the WTA Tour.&nbsp;</p><p>The 26-year-old had previously talked to The Times of India about his journey to becoming a tennis coach in 2021. Since childhood, Max was certain he couldn’t be a tennis player.</p><p>The former coach said with the sport being expensive, he didn’t have the financial support to continue playing it after 12. He then joined a tennis academy in Belgium, where he doubled as a coach for kids.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/max-wenders-sofia-kenin.jpg><p>In 2018, he coached Dutch player Demi Schuurs who played doubles with Ash Barty, and the duo won the tennis tournaments in Rome and Montreal.&nbsp;</p><p>Max was also the hitting partner for Jelena Ostapenko and has also worked with Anastasiya Komardina and Anett Kontaveit. In 2021, Wenders was banned for 12 years by ITIA for multiple match-fixing charges and was fined $12,000.&nbsp;</p><p>The former tennis coach briefly dated Sofia Kenin and had previously shared a birthday post for Wenders on her Instagram story. The tennis player has never talked about Wenders or her relationship with him in the media.&nbsp;</p><p>Max is available on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> with the username @max_wenders and recently shared he was taking his health seriously and going to the gym five times a week.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sofia Kenin Parents, Alexander, And Svetlana Kenin</h2><p>Sofia Kenin’s parents, Alexander and Svetlana Kenin, had to go through many adversities to raise their two daughters.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexander and Svetlana were previously residents of the then-Soviet Union. They came to the US in 1987 with only $286 making stops through Italy and Austria.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sofia-kenin-parents.jpg><p>Svetlana was a nurse in the former Soviet Union, and Alexander balanced double life while in the States. He studied computer programming during the day, and at night he would drive car services.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple had their eldest daughter, Sofia, in Moscow as they required support from their family. But Sofia has chosen to represent the country she was raised in, the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexander was the one to coach his daughter since her formative years and remains one of her coaches. On <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, Sofia has shared several appreciation posts for her dad, who sacrificed a lot for his family.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC%2Fzp%2BgmmWbmruquoybprKeop6yr7CMoqpmq5iaeqWt06KloGWRo8awusRmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZaSeuqa4yKecaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kia-joorabchian-mammas-girl-newmarket-1000-guineas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kia Joorabchian's incredible 636-1 treble headlined by &amp;quot;amazing&amp;quot; winner Mamma's Girl who is now 8-1</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./xaviera-hollander.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Xaviera Hollander net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
