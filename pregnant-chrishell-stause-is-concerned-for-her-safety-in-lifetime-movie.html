Because it is lonelier out here,” Zoe says while growing increasingly frustrated with Kennedy. “Do you always have to respond?”</p><p>Kennedy attempts to get Zoe to stay with her. “OK, look I will put it away. I’m done. Sit down,” she says. “Please, baby. Stay [and] sit.”</p><p>The couple are interrupted by a rustling in the woods behind them. Zoe and Kennedy soon realize that<a href=#> the townspeople of Wildwood</a> decided to pay them a visit — and they have gifts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pregnant-Chrishell-Stause-Feels-Far-From-Welcome-in-Lifetime-s-You-re-Not-Supposed-to-Be-Here-718.jpg><p>“We brought some herbs from our communal garden. They are for prenatal support [because] we heard you had some trouble finding vitamins at the store,” one of the locals tells Zoe after offering her a basket of mysterious items.</p><p>You’re Not Supposed to Be Here is an upcoming LGBTQIA+ thriller that <a href=#>follows an expectant couple as they travel to a remote mountain town</a> on a babymoon. The trip takes a turn when Zoe starts to feel uncomfortable with how the townspeople are looking at her. Zoe <a href=#>assumes it’s because she’s in a same-sex couple</a>, but quickly discovers there’s something else the locals want from her.</p><p>The Lifetime movie also stars <strong>Curtis Hamilton</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Heather Matarazzo</strong></a>, <strong>Devon Gummersall, Drew Powell, Jeante Godlock </strong>and<strong> Alejandro Rosario.</strong> You’re Not Supposed to Be Here marks Stause’s second project with the network since returning to acting.</p><p>Stause, 42, got her big break playing Amanda Dillon on <a href=#>All My Children</a> from 2005 to 2011 and subsequently appeared on soaps <a href=#>Days of Our Lives</a> and The Young and the Restless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-31-at-14.51.01.jpg><p>In 2019, Stause found success documenting <a href=#>her real estate career — and her personal life</a> — on Netflix’s <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a>. The reality show became an instant hit on the streaming service, with Stause as one of the few cast members who <a href=#>has been part of the series since the beginning.</a></p><p>After recently being honored in <a href=#>Us Weekly‘s Reality Stars of the Year inaugural issue</a>, Stause recalled <a href=#>her initial expectations going into Selling Sunset.</a></p><p>“I sold a few houses, but nothing on this luxury platform like we do on the show. So I thought it was very much going to be based on that. But [given] how personal it’s gotten, that took a big turn that I was not expecting,” Stause, who was crowned Us’ Spitfire, shared earlier this month. “[When things got] out of my control, I ended up jumping into the deep end of that. I think that’s something I wouldn’t have chosen. But it ended up being something that I’ve embraced.”</p><p>Stause, who is in a <a href=#>committed relationship with partner <strong>G Flip</strong></a>, has since found her stride when it comes to the show, saying, “To have connected with people in this way, it’s just always going to beat out any of the negatives. It was all worth it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. In the past, I always questioned myself. But you get to a place where you say f–k it, this is my life, and you’re going to see the good, the bad and the ugly. Being able just to live, whether people approve or not, has been the most freeing thing.”</p><p>You’re Not Supposed to Be Here premieres on Lifetime Saturday, November 4, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKernZejrq%2FAjJyfq6GjnbKtuIysq5qto5p6qr%2BMnKanm5Wnu6awjJ%2Bmq2WYmr9uv8CfnK2xXZ67brjIn5ytoZ2aeq671aKcaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-foley.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Foley- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./irving-berlin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Irving Berlin</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
