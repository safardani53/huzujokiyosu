His relationship with his siblings, especially his biological brother, Carter Cooper, inspired him to be a journalist.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He decided to be a journalist after his brother's death by suicide in 1988. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The Cooper Siblings</h2><p>Anderson had a very close relationship with Carter. Their parents, Gloria Vanderbilt and Wyatt Cooper, gave birth to Anderson in 1967.</p><p>Carter was born two years before his younger brother. The Cooper siblings were very close to their parents as well.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The family of four turned into a family of three after Wyatt died in 1978. He succumbed to heart attacks while having open-heart surgery. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Anderson was ten, whereas this brother was 12. Sadly, Carter became the head of the family and had a hard time dealing with his father's death.</p><p>This eventually led to depression, and as a result, Carter committed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suicide</a>. He jumped from the terrace of his mother's penthouse in Manhattan. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To make matters worse, Vanderbilt witnessed everything.&nbsp;On July 22, 1988, he died ten years after Wyatt's death. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>It was difficult for Anderson to cope with his brother's death.&nbsp;It has been over three-decade since Carter's suicide, and to date, the journalist wonders about it.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Cooper siblings, Carter and Anderson,&nbsp;posing for a picture when they were young. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a> in September 2021 that he had a lot of questions about Carter's demise.&nbsp;He confessed that there was not a single day he did not think about the devastating loss in his family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The trajectory of his life has been altered since he lost his loved ones when he was young.&nbsp;He often wonders what would happen if Carter was still alive and how the relationship between the Cooper siblings would thrive.</p><p>It has been almost 34 years since Carter's death, and Anderson pays homage to him every year.&nbsp;He shares pictures of them when they were young and reminisces those days.</p><h2>Anderson Cooper's Half-Siblings</h2><p>Anderson has two older half-siblings&nbsp;from his mother's side,&nbsp;Leopold Stanislaus "Stan" Stokowski and&nbsp;Christopher Stokowski. Stan was born in 1950, whereas Christopher was born in 1952.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The CNN journalist adored his half-brother Christopher when he was young. He used to be close with Christopher and his&nbsp;fiancée, April Sandmeyer, despite being almost fifteen years younger than them.</p><p>However, when Anderson was ten years old, at the same time around when Wyatt died, Christopher and Sandmeyer left them. They vanished into thin air, leaving Anderson devastated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Christopher and his partner left the family after feuding with Vanderbilt's therapist. It is reported that the therapist interfered in his love life, which did not please him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, Anderson was reunited decades later with his half-brother when they worked on the movie, Nothing Left Unsaid.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The journalist confirmed to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Page Six</a>&nbsp;in 2016 that the film interested Christopher, who got in touch with him through his spouse.&nbsp;Christopher also got in touch with his mother, seemingly&nbsp;burying the hatchet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmembKzv86nZJynn6Wys3nSopmloZ6cwG%2B006aj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./does-mariah-carey-lip-sync.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Mariah Carey Lip-Sync?
