"We have this saying, C and C, [because] we always knew we would work together when we were older." Clearly, it was friendship at first sight.</p><p>Given their history, we weren't surprised when Cassie tasked Christina with helping her to reveal the gender of her second baby (yes, she's pregnant).

And we assumed right. Christina revealed during an exclusive interview with Distractify that while filming an episode of Christina on the Coast, the besties encountered something they never thought they’d run into – a swarm of bees!</p><p>“We were filming this scene, and as we’re filming, all of a sudden, we hear this buzzing, and literally like 1,000 bees came out,” Christina lightheartedly shared. The TV personality says they both immediately ran in different directions, “like a scene out of I Love Lucy, back and forth zig zagging.” I guess faulty wiring isn’t the only thing Christina comes across when renovating homes!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Aside from having to confront some unfriendly creatures on set, Christina says she and Cassie will often try to surprise each other while the cameras are rolling.</p><p>During Season 4 of Christina on the Coast, Cassie surprises Christina by telling her she's pregnant with her second child, and wants her to assist with the gender reveal. The news left Christina speechless, and of course, overjoyed. But we imagine it wasn't easy being the only one, aside from her husband <a href=#>Josh Hall</a>, knowing whether Cassie would be having a boy or girl.</p><p>Spoiler alert: Cassie is having a boy!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christina previously renovated Cassie's childhood home.</h2><p>The very first episode of Christina on the Coast featured Cassie’s residence in Anaheim Hills, Calif. "I saw a meme today that said, 'a friend knocks on your door, but a best friend walks in and eats your food,' and that’s us," Cassie previouly told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House Beautiful</a> of her relationship with Christina.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"We’ve gone to junior high, high school, and college together — we even lived together in college — and we’ve been through everything together," she continued. "I consider her family."</p><p>Cassie said it felt natural to film alongside her BFF. "Christina and I have such good chemistry in real life, and we just did our thing, like we do every day together," she explained. "At this point, [shooting with HGTV] is just part of my life, so the cameras are normal."</p><p>In fact, the most difficult thing for Cassie turned out to be "trusting the process" as her longtime pal gutted the kitchen and dining room.</p><p>"Christina and I have very similar tastes, and I knew she wouldn’t do something she wouldn’t want in her own home in mine," the L.A. native acknowledged. "I’ve always been a huge champion of Christina."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cassie from 'Christina on the Coast' owns a PR company.</h2><p>You can hire the brunette beauty’s firm, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CMZPR</a>, to help with media relations, crisis management, and brand partnerships. Cassie's newest client is the XFL, a company co-owned by <a href=#>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a>. She previously worked as the senior communications director for AEG, a leading sports and entertainment conglomerate.</p><p>In July 2020, Cassie and a few of her colleagues launched a new venture called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reBUILD20</a> in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The enterprise, which catered to clients who relied on in-person consumer interaction, developed "creative and actionable operations plans" that factor in the ever-changing protocols related to the health crisis.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On top of running a business, Cassie is also expecting her second child with husband James Schienle. The professional chef proposed in March 2020, shortly before coronavirus lockdowns went into effect, and the two tied the knot on March 6, 2021. Shortly after wedding, the couple welcomed their first child.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible," Cassie wrote when announcing the engagement <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>.
