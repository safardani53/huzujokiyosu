She has an older sister Ella, who is 13, as well as older brothers Drake, 14, and Duke, 11. Emmie also has a younger brother Crew, who is 17 months old.</p><p>Speaking of Crew, the toddler sat across from his older sibling while she rolled out the last of the cookie dough and he happily waited with some festive cookie cutters in hand. According to Joanna, Emmie’s final product was delicious.</p><p>“Let’s just say this was one of my favorite cookies I’ve ever tasted!” the Fixer Upper star declared. “It was like a perfect blend of a shortbread cookie and chocolate chip cookie topped with a yummy icing.”</p><p>However, taste and texture weren’t the only factors the proud mom considered when evaluating the finished cookie. “I also love what she named them in her little cookbook, ‘Emmie Kay’s chocolate chip kisses cookie,’” the Kansas native noted.</p><p>Believe it or not, Emmie isn’t the only Gaines kiddo who has expressed an interest in getting involved in the family business. Back in August, when the Gaines family’s Magnolia Press coffee shop was still <a href=#>under construction</a>, Joanna revealed that her teenage daughter was already angling for a gig. “Ella keeps asking me if she can get a job there, because she’s always wanted to work at a coffee shop,” the HGTV star explained at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though the new business<a href=#> formally opened</a> at Magnolia Market earlier this month, Ella isn’t bringing home a paycheck just yet.</p><p>However, the middle school student has found creative ways to earn cash in the past. “Her new summer business is selling baked goods at the office when she goes to work with me,” Joanna wrote in a June Instagram post about her oldest daughter. “Tonight we stayed up late and she made Aunt Opal’s banana pudding and the chocolate chip cookies from my cookbook.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqOnkaO7onnGmqCnnaNisaLBxqGrnqpdmrqutcRmmquZlqmypXnHnqlmp6ejeqS7zqSgnmWimrCqvMRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-allen-mom-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Allen Gave His Mom the Best Birthday Gift</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./janet-waldo-dies-voice-of-judy-jetson-was-96.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Janet Waldo Dies; Voice of Judy Jetson Was 96</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
