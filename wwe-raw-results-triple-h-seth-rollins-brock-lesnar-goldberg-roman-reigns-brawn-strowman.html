who ruined his chances of beating Owens at the Rumble.</p><p>The Big Dog struck Strowman with three successive superman punches, before leaping off the steel steps to spear the monster.</p><p>This resulted in a disqualification, meaning Owens keeps his title AGAIN!</p><p>But Reigns was not done there, he speared a stricken Owens.</p><p>As Jericho and Owens showed of their belts at the start of the show, Braun Strowman furiously entered the fray after ambushing Roman Reigns, allowing Owens to keep his title at the Rumble.</p><p>But the Monster Among Men did not want to be thanked for his services, he was there to claim his title&nbsp;shot Owens promised - Mick Foley then emerged and confirmed the match.</p><p>Confirming Strowman would have his title shot on <a href=#>Monday Night Raw</a>!</p><p>With this bombshell landed on his pal, Jericho had to take on Zayn without his belt on the line.</p><p>Zayn took his opportunity with both hands and was all over Jericho like a rash and dominated the opening stages.</p><p>Jericho had a chance to get back into the match but Zayn jumped off the crowd barrier and flattened his opponent.</p><p>But Zayn then found himself tied up by the Walls of Jericho but he managed to escape by grabbing the bottom rope.</p><p>He then suplexed Jericho into the turnbuckle then instantly struck him with a Helluva Kick to pin and impressively beat the champ.</p><p><a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> appeared in on Monday Night Raw after Goldberg embarrassed him for a second time at Royal Rumble.</p><p>Lesnar's partner, Paul Heyman, made an inspirational speech on his client's behalf despite Golderg chants ringing around the arena.</p><p>But Lesnar has challenged Goldberg to for a match&nbsp;at WrestleMania!</p><p>Sheamus and tag-team partner Cesaro joined forces with Bayley to take on Luke Gallows and Carl Anderson who also had Charlotte Flair on their side.</p><p>The Celtic Warrior and Cesaro were seeking revenge after Gallows and Anderson took their tag team title at Royal Rumble, whilst Charlotte maintained her title over Bayley too at the pay-per-view event.</p><p>But despite their defeats at the Rumble, the trio joined forces and righted their wrongs on Monday Raw.</p><p>Some dirty tactics from Charlotte saw her distract Cesaro - allowing Gallows to boot him off the top rope.</p><p>But the tide turned after Sheamus clotheslined Gallows from the top rope, before him and Cesaro showed great team work to flatten Gallows.</p><p>And then Bailey rounded off the win by flattening Charlotte before successfully pinning the champion.</p><p>Enzo Amore and Big Cass took on Rusev and Jinder Mahal in a tornado tag-team match, meaning no tag is required and all four wrestlers can be in the ring at the same time.</p><p>The chaotic match saw action take place in and out of the ring as this rivalry has been brewing for a few months.</p><p>The Bulgarian Brute and Mahal were toying with Big Cass and Amore and resulted in the latter being beaten in a two-on-one situation.</p><p>But Big Cass recovered to save his teammate by throwing Mahal out of the ring before giving Rusev an Empire Elbow Drop but the pin was stopped just in time by Mahal.</p><p>And as Big Cass was outnumbered in the ring, Amore dragged Mahal out of the ring before combining with Big Cass to flatten Rusev.</p><p>He then leaped off the top rope before pinning Rusev.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Related stories</h2></p><p>Sasha Banks walked into the ring to face Nia Jax for a rematch after she lost to her at the Rumble.</p><p>Banks had her left leg bandaged up and her strong mentality saw stand up to Jax but it was only a matter of time before Jax manhandled.</p><p>The bell then rang, signalling the end to the match but Jax persisted to inflict more pain on her injured knee.</p><p>The referee was unable to stop the annihilation but it wasn't until Banks' good friend Bayley came to her safety to stop Jax.</p><p>Neville menacingly walked into the ring after becoming king of the cruiserweights at the Rumble but his threatening speech was bravely interrupted by Rich Swann.</p><p>Swann showed great class after giving nothing but respect to Neville for taking his title off him.</p><p>But Swann was not done there. He beat down Neville who scrambled out of the ring - declaring that he wants his title back.</p><p>The Cruiserweight division saw an energetic match take place between Tony Nese and Mustafa Ali - which was full of energy.</p><p>The pair were at full&nbsp;speed but it was over in a flash as The Premier Athlete dominated Ali&nbsp;but he continued to have no time for the critics after his impressive win.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH94gJRwa29np6yybr7AsGSrnaOqubW%2FjK2poqicmnqpedKeq6FloqS5rbXNrGSbqp%2BYuG64xKylmqpdnLytsMGeqaBloqS6orqMq5yin56oeqO%2BwLClZqukp7y4ucCnZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dickie-rock.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dickie Rock- Net Worth, Biography, Wife, Age, Height, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-mackenyu-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Mackenyu Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
