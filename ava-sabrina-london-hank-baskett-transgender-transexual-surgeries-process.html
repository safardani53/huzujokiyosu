I did her makeup, her hair, styled her. I wished I was my sister. But I never thought I’d transition.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>After growing up as a boy named “Paul” in Modesto, Calif., Ava finally decided, with some hesitation, to start undergoing hormone therapy in 2011 as the first step to transition from a man to a woman. After that, Ava racked up a shocking 18 surgeries to complete the transformation. She started with DD breast implants, then two rhinoplasty surgeries, a chin shave and a facelift.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Then in May 2012, Ava continued to get work done to fully feminize her face, including a brow bone contour, a hairline reduction, pulling back of her eyes, and a third nose job. She also had liposuction in her abs and her lower back. And a year after that, she underwent eight sessions of silicon injections in her hips and butt to give her that now-curvy look. She then got a full-body laser treatment to further soften her masculine features.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In all, Ava’s laundry list of surgeries totaled $50,000, a cost which her ex-boyfriend covered. “When I had all the money I was able to do it all at once,” Ava said. “I’ve been very fortunate.&nbsp;I was with a group of best friends and they were doing it. I was lost and my friend wanted me to move to L.A. in 2011. And we all transitioned together.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Somewhat surprisingly, Ava says she has not faced much persecution as a transgendered model: “With all the stories you hear with gay bashing or beating up, my transition has been easy.” And though she does get Botox treatments and Juvaderm injections in her lips once every six months, there is one big surgery that Ava has not had yet — genital reconstruction. “I’ve thought about it,” Ava said, before indicating that it may be a long way off. “It’s not on my to-do list anytime soon. But not to say I’d never do it. I think I’m pretty much done for now. I don’t want to go overboard.”</p><h3>Kendra Wilkinson & Hank Baskett’s Marriage On The Rocks</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Ava Sabrina London has been thrust into the public eye after&nbsp;she&nbsp;alleged that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hank Baskett cheated</a> on his wife,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kendra Wilkinson</strong></a>, with her. According to Ava, her relationship with Hank started as an online flirtation, but that eventually they met in person, and he paid her for sexual acts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Now Kendra is reeling — she’s been spotted out without her wedding band — and her marriage with Hank is definitely in doubt. “Between the baby hormones and this, friends worry she could be in a dangerous place,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What do you think about all this,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
