And that’s all I have to say,” she said in the video, which was shared on her story.</p><p>In the wake of the situation, fans were again made to think if&nbsp;Lewis’ social media was hacked, and that had something to do with her Instagram posts removal and&nbsp;cryptic tweet.</p><p><br><strong>Mads Lewis and Christian Plourde break up rumors started after they unfollowed each other on Instagram.</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;tiktokinsiders's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But later when fans noticed that&nbsp;Sevryn had also removed the couple’s posts and both of them had unfollowed each other on social media, it seemed likely that&nbsp;Lewis and&nbsp;Sevryn had a break up.</p><h2>Fans Upset over Mads Lewis and Christian Plourde’s Split</h2><p>While both Lewis and Sevryn are yet to address or confirm the break up rumors, fans already seem upset over the news of their split.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>At the same time, many are blaming&nbsp;Lewis for being the reason for the separation, while implying Sevryn deserves a better woman in his life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>“I bet he got sick of her always talking about jaden and nessa. She had a whole man who wanted to cherish her and she just wanted problems. Maybe now she’ll understand lmaoooo,” a well-wisher of&nbsp;Sevryn commented on&nbsp;@tiktokinsiders’ Instagram post.</p><p>In the same post, another chimed, “now nobody could use the excuse she’s ‘hacked.’”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A fangirl similarly speculated the couple was no longer dating each other. She also added that the news didn’t surprise anyone because&nbsp;Lewis often talked about her ex-boyfriends, even though she had a caring man by her side.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Adding to the context,&nbsp;Lewis previously had an on-and-off relationship with&nbsp;Hossler from September 2019 to early 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They had a rough patch in their relationship around March 2020, when Hossler <a href=# rel=follow>grew closeness to Nessa Barrett</a> after their song collaboration.</p><p>The latter couple even confirmed their relationship later. Meanwhile, Lewis, who was not&nbsp;happy about the drama, eventually claimed that her ex-boyfriend cheated on her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRmcBuuMSwoKxlk52%2Fqr%2FTopinZaChvLa%2Bw55km6qVlrhuwc9nn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./todd-rutherford.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Todd Rutherford net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./from-scratch-netflix-filming-location.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'From Scratch' Filming Locations: Details on Netflix Romance</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
