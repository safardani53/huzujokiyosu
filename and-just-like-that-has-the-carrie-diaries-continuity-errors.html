But you got to New York when you were 21? Wait a second, 21 plus 35 — hold up, are you old?” Aidan quipped <a href=#>while walking down the pier</a> with Carrie.</p><p class=p1>According to Carrie and Aidan, the 56-year-old relationship author first arrived in the Big Apple in her early 20s. While <a href=#>their math checks out</a>, it completely erases the premise of <i>The Carrie Diaries</i>, the short-lived CW spinoff that followed<a href=#> a young Carrie’s first years</a> in the city. (<i>The Carrie Diaries </i>was inspired by the novel of the same name, which was written by <i>Sex and the City </i>scribe <a href=#><strong>Candace Bushnell</strong> </a>and published in 2011.)</p><p class=p1>In <i>The Carrie Diaries</i>’ pilot episode, which aired in 2013, 16-year-old Carrie (<a href=#><strong>AnnaSophia Robb</strong></a>) accepted an internship at a law firm in the city to help distract her from the overwhelming grief following her mother’s death. Carrie — who lived in Castlebury, Connecticut, with father Tom (<strong>Matt Letscher</strong>) and sister Dorit (<strong>Stefania LaVie Owen</strong>) — would commute into the city via the train. During her first week, she meets <i>Interview </i>magazine editor Larissa (<a href=#><strong>Freema Agyeman</strong></a>), who is wowed by her custom “Carrie” purse and offers her an internship of her own.</p><p class=p1>Season 2 of <i>The Carrie Diaries </i>allowed Carrie to further flourish in the big city, living there full-time for the summer while continuing to work at<i> Interview</i>. <i>The Carrie Diaries </i>was ultimately canceled in 2014.</p><p class=p1>While <i>The Carrie Diaries</i> garnered a crowd of devoted fans, Parker, now 58, was not among them.</p><p class=p1>“You know, I think it’s one of those tests of your generosity,” the<a href=#><i> Hocus Pocus </i></a>star tol<a href=#>d Net-a-Porter’s <i>The Edit </i></a>in a March 2013 profile when asked about the spinoff. “[AnnaSophia Robb] is a lovely girl and I want her to feel good about it, but it’s … odd.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/And-Just-Like-That-Has-The-Carrie-Diaries-Continuity-Errors-2.jpg><p class=p1>While Parker was “not sure” about the prequel, Robb, now 29, was excited about landing the role of young Carrie.</p><p class=p1>“I realized it was actually a really strong story,” she previously <a href=#>gushed to <i>Teen Vogue </i>one month earlier</a> in February 2013. “It had a lot of heart and integrity, and Carrie seems like a character that I can grow with.”</p><p class=p1>Robb continued at the time: “They told me that I got the part because I did a little chicken dance at the end of my audition after they asked me about my prom. I’ve got rhythm, but not the moves to go with it, and I guess they liked that I wasn’t afraid to be goofy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Thursday’s episode is not the first time that <i>Sex and the City </i>has<a href=#> ignored <i>The Carrie Diaries</i>’ story lines</a>. The OG series once mentioned that Carrie’s father had left her family growing up, which is not the case in <i>The Carrie Diaries </i>as Tom is a single parent for the duration of the show. The second feature-length movie also reinvented how Carrie met her besties.&nbsp; Carrie explained that she met Charlotte (<a href=#><strong>Kristin Davis</strong></a>), Miranda (<a href=#><strong>Cynthia Nixon</strong></a>) and Samantha (<a href=#><strong>Kim Cattrall</strong></a>) in that order, which deviates from the CW series. <i>The Carrie Diaries</i> season 2 <a href=#>introduced young Samantha</a> (<strong>Lindsay Gort</strong>) long before Charlotte and Miranda arrived on the scene. (Per the <i>Carrie Diaries </i>books, Carrie met new NYC arrival Charlotte last on the train when she was departing NYC after her summer adventure.)</p><p class=p1><i>And Just Like That </i>drops new episodes Thursdays on Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJinnF2fwrTAjKWgpJ1dqbWiwIyhmKxlpJ2ybq%2FAq6minV2ZtqK%2ByJ6qZpufo8GqutSiq7Jllae%2FsL7SaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chick-fil-a-fry-scam.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Couple Shares Chick-fil-A Fry Scam With &amp;quot;FryGate&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ruthless-star-michelle-nunez-cried-while-filming-intense-scenes-tyler-perry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ruthless Star Michelle Nuez on Filming 'Intense' Scenes with Tyler Perry</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
