Filming is already underway, and we’ve gotten a few glimpses of key scenes in the upcoming sequel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>For those that haven’t seen it, Beetlejuice&nbsp;follows deceased couple Adam and Barbara Maitland, played by&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Alec Baldwin</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Geena Davis</a></strong>, who try to scare away a family now living in their house. They make contact with an over-the-top bio-exorcist named Betelgeuse, but his antics only complicate matters.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Beetlejuice 2 was officially confirmed in February 2022, per <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>, with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a>‘s Plan B Entertainment producing alongside Warner Bros. From the release date to the cast and crew, <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>has rounded up everything to know about the highly-anticipated sequel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/beetlejuice-2-release-date-ec-embed.jpg><h2>Beetlejuice 2 Cast & Crew</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The original&nbsp;Beetlejuice&nbsp;stars <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Catherine O’Hara</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jeffrey Jones</strong></a> as Delia and Charles Deetz, who move into the Maitland’s old house and become terrorized by Betelgeuse. <strong>Winona Ryder</strong> plays their goth teenage daughter, Lydia Deetz, who becomes friends with the friendly Maitland ghosts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>So far, <strong>Michael Keaton</strong>, Winona, Geena, and Catherine are the cast members set to return for Beetlejuice 2.&nbsp;The film wouldn’t be possible without Betelgeuse himself, so thank goodness Michael’s coming back!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Beetlejuice is the most f***in’ fun you can have working. It’s so fun, it’s so great. And you know what it is? We’re doing it exactly like we did the first movie,” Michael told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Empire</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/beetlejuice-2-michael-keaton-ec-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The actor continued, “[Burton] and I were talking about it years and years ago, never telling anybody. We’ve both said we’re doing it many times. We both agreed, if it happens, it has to be done as close to the way we made it the first time. Making stuff up, making stuff happen, improvising and riffing, but literally handmade stuff like people creating things with their hands and building something.” He added, “It’s the most fun I’ve had working on a movie in I can’t tell you how long.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Winona, who currently stars in Netflix’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stranger Things</a>, previously expressed interest in starring in a Beetlejuice&nbsp;sequel. “I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me,” Winona told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Beast</a>&nbsp;in 2013. “I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Other cast members’ returns have yet to be announced. Alec’s return is questionable due to the controversy from the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rust&nbsp;shooting incident</a>. Geena Davis’ return is also unclear, but she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> in 2022 that she “would, of course, like to revisit” the character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jenna-ortega-beetlejuice-2-update-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>In March 2023, it was reported by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a> that<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Wednesday</a> breakout star <strong>Jenna Ortega</strong> was in talks to join the sequel. Her casting was confirmed in April 2023 at CinemaCon. This marks her second project with Burton, who is expected to direct Beetlejuice 2.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The famous filmmaker has been asked about having <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Johnny Depp</a> </strong>star in&nbsp;Beetlejuice 2&nbsp;and didn’t deny anything when he spoke to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MTV </a>about the possibility in 2012. Tim and Johnny enjoy working together and have already brought incredible films to the screen, such as Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hallow, Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, and&nbsp;Sweeney Todd. However, Johnny’s possible role may be in jeopardy because of his&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>defamation trial</a>&nbsp;against&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Amber Heard</a></strong>, which has&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>impacted his career</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/beetlejuice-2-release-date-ec-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Tim is listed as the film’s director per IMDb, and he has confirmed his interest in the past. In 2015, he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider&nbsp;</a>he would sign on to direct a sequel if it made sense. “This is the thing, it’s something that I’m interested in, but there’s so many stories [online], dumping Michael Keaton for Johnny Depp and this or that, and I’ve talked to these people and they didn’t wanna hear this so they just made up a story,” he pressed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“But the fact of it is I have talked to Michael and I have talked to Winona, I’ve talked to a few people,” he continued. “It’s something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it’s one of those films where it has to be right. It’s not a kind of a movie that cries out [for a sequel], it’s not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it’s something that if the elements are right — because I do love the character and Michael’s amazing as that character, so yeah we’ll see. But there’s nothing concrete yet.” That’s certainly promising!</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Michael shared a similar sentiment when he spoke about the potential sequel in 2016. “It’s possible that ship has sailed,” he told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. “The only way to do it is to do it right. So much of it was improvised, and so much was beautifully handmade by the artist that is Tim Burton. If you can’t get close to that, you leave it alone.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Furthermore, Geena revealed that she “would of course like to revisit” Beetlejuice in an October 2022 chat with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>, but also said she has no information about the sequel and has not yet been contacted about it. “I want to play every character I’ve ever played again,” she added. As mentioned before, Plan B Entertainment and Warner Bros. will produce Beetlejuice 2.</p><h2>Beetlejuice 2 Filming News</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Production began on Beetlejuice 2 in May 2023 amid the ongoing writers’ strike. <strong>Winona Ryder</strong> was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen back in character</a> as Lydia Deetz on May 18 in Hertfordshire, England. After 35 years, Lydia’s still got her spiky hair and vampy makeup look.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>On July 5, <strong>Jenna Ortega</strong> and Winona were spotted filming what appears to be a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding scene for the sequel</a>. Jenna was in full wedding attire, including a white tulle gown with some added pink coloring, a wedding veil, and more. Winona was covered up in a black parka as she prepared to film a scene.</p><h2>The Link To The Original Beetlejuice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/beetlejuice-2-release-date-ec-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19><strong>Michael McDowell </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Warren Skaaren</strong> wrote the screenplay for the original Beetlejuice, while Tim directed. The movie was a massive hit after its 1998 release and even won the Academy Award for Best Makeup in 1999. Its success spawned numerous offshoots, starting with an animated TV series of the same name that ran on ABC, and then Fox, from 1989 to 1991. Tim produced the project. Then, several Beetlejuice&nbsp;video games were released, starting in 1990. The popular film was also adapted into a Broadway stage musical that opened in April 2019. The show closed in March 2020 due to the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>COVID-19 pandemic</a>&nbsp;but reopened at the Marquis Theatre in April 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>No plot details have been revealed for&nbsp;Beetlejuice 2. It would make sense for the sequel to take place many years after the events of the first film. Spoiler alert: Beetlejuice&nbsp;ends with the Deetzes and Maitlands living in the home harmoniously, while Betelgeuse ends up in the afterlife waiting room and gets his head shrunk by a witch doctor.</p><h2>Production Trivia</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>It’s been a long road to&nbsp;Beetlejuice 2. Plans for the sequel began in 1990 when Tim hired <strong>Jonathan Gems&nbsp;</strong>to write a second movie called&nbsp;Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ScreenRant</a>. It would’ve focused on the Deetzes moving to Hawaii, where they are haunted by a spirit. Michael and Winona agreed to the sequel, however, Tim became distracted with directing <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Batman Returns</a>, which starred Michael as the iconic caped-crusader. Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian&nbsp;was eventually shelved entirely by 1997.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/beetlejuice-2-release-date-ec-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-22>Plans for a different sequel started up in 2011. Warner Bros. hired <strong>Seth Grahame-Smith</strong>, who worked with Tim on Dark Shadows&nbsp;and&nbsp;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, to write and produce the project. Winona even gushed about the sequel in a 2013 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Beast</a>. “I’m kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening. It’s 27 years later,” she confirmed. “And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later.” However, that sequel was also canceled.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>In 2021, Seth himself spoke about the canceled sequel. “It’s funny, when I had met with Tim about it last, and we’re talking about five years ago at this point, the reason that it’s so hard to get going is because so many people love it and because there are 10 million ways to get that sequel wrong and four ways to get it right,” he explained to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider </a>in Oct. 2021. “It’s such a very fine needle to thread that I certainly like didn’t get it there, on the script side. I didn’t thread the needle. There are things that were cool and some interesting ideas. I’ve certainly emotionally moved on from it and just said, ‘If it happens someday, it happens.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GenK2klZ%2FCqq%2FEZmlmbGdlg3WDkGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./double-shot-at-love-vinny-erika-fight-preview.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vinny &amp;amp; Erika Fight &amp;amp; He Calls Her Wrong Name Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rita-moreno-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rita Moreno Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
