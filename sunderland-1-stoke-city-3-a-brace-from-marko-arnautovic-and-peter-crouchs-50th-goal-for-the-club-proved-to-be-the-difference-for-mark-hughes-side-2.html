Only Alan Shearer with 23 has scored more.</li><li>You would not be shocked if Defoe asked to leave the club before the month is out. West Ham have had one bid rejected but the striker could hand in a transfer request.</li><li>Sunderland currently have 11 players missing – eight injured and three at the African Nations Cup. Only Hull have as many men out.
