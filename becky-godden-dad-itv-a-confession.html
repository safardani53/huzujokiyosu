ITV have a lot to answer for. They should hang their heads in shame.”</p><p>The drama follows the investigations into the deaths of sex worker Becky, 21, and personal assistant Sian O'Callaghan, 22, at the hands of evil taxi driver Christopher Halliwell.</p><p>Becky was strangled and decapitated in 2003 by Halliwell who buried her body in a field in Gloucestershire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000269634070.jpg><p>He had become besotted with her after meeting her while working as a taxi driver in the red-light district of Swindon.</p><p>Becky had run away from home and become “disconnected” from her family after she became hooked on heroin and sniffing aerosols.</p><p>Her family only reported her missing in 2007 – four years after the murder – after relatives became increasingly concerned about her whereabouts.</p><p>But her murder only came to light in 2011 when Halliwell was arrested over the disappearance of Sian.</p><p>After he led cops to the spot where he dumped Sian's body - and was subsequently charged with her murder - he offered detectives "another one".</p><p>He then took officers to the place where he'd buried Becky's headless corpse eight years earlier.<br></p><h2>SHE'D BE 'TURNING IN HER GRAVE'</h2><p>Becky’s dad John said Becky would be “turning in her grave if she had seen the way I’ve been treated”.</p><p>He claims he pleaded with ITV not to air scenes which made him look like an uncaring oaf – and says they did not respect his wishes.</p><p>“When I saw the show I sat there in shock at how I was being portrayed – even the way the actor was dressed was nothing like me.</p><p>“I lost a daughter in the most horrific way. To not show me any compassion is disgusting. You don’t do that to people who are grieving.”</p><p>John vented his fury at being painted as an unfit dad who did nothing to help find his missing daughter.</p><h2>'IT'S ALL LIES'</h2><p>He highlighted a scene where he says the family was blamed for confusing the search, insisting: “It’s all lies”.</p><p>The heartbroken dad revealed he was trolled on social media over his portrayal as a disinterested dad and felt too scared to leave his house.</p><p>And he never got to meet the actor who played him in the drama, Christopher Fulford.</p><p>A spokesman for ITV said: “We listened to what John had to say and, where possible, amended some scenes to reflect his thoughts.</p><p>“We are satisfied that what was depicted in the finished piece was both accurate and fair.”</p><p>The six-part series, attracted five million viewers when it aired in September, was based on a book written by Detective Supt Steve Fulcher, played by Martin Freeman.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Becky’s mum, Karen Edwards, had a more positive reaction to the telly drama.</p><p>She previously told The Sun how it felt like she was “holding Becky again” when she embraced the actress playing her murdered daughter.</p><p>In A Confession, Karen is played by Imelda Staunton and said: “The drama came as a welcome distraction to everyone in our family.</p><p>She revealed she met Imelda three times — twice before filming and once on set.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JH-BECKY-COMPOSITE.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JH-KAREN-COMPOSITE.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JH-CHRIS-COMPOSITE.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JH-STEVE-COMPOSITE.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>A Confession spoilers: Prime suspect buckles as Steve piles on pressure in search for missing Sian</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn10fZRra2pnkpqwrMWMoKadnJWjeqWtw2agra5dlnqku82fnKyrmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-kate-moss-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>It's Been 25 Years Since Kate Moss Dated Johnny Depp and She Has Since Traded Up</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aretha-franklin-tour-manager-ken-cunningham.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who was Aretha Franklin's tour manager Ken Cunningham?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
