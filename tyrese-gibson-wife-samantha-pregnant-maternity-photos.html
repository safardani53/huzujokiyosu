At one point in the shoot she posed in a bathtub, which was inspired by a similar photo she and Tyrese had seen elsewhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“To go almost completely bare in a lot of photos was an extremely, extremely challenging experience,” Samantha, a social worker, tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“But on the bright side,” she adds, “I was really happy because pregnancy is a process. Your body is changing, and to be able to accept that change publicly and really just put it out there like that confidently — I tried to trick myself into thinking I was doing something for women all over the world.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Want all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Babies newsletter</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Derek Blanks Photography</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Derek Blanks Photography</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Derek Blanks Photography</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Derek Blanks Photography</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tyrese, 39, says his goal was always that Samantha be the focus of the shoot. “I actually purposely stayed out of a lot of photos,” he says. “I told her this is a moment that I really wanted to capture <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>with her and her daughter</a>,” baby Soraya, who is due at the end of September.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Samantha calls the experience bittersweet. “Normally I would work really hard to not have a belly,” she says, “so it’s been quite an experience seeing my belly and our baby grow. It’s like having front row seats to watching a miracle occur in my body.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Samantha plans to give birth in Georgia and that’s where Soraya will be primarily raised, in the same house <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>where Samantha and Tyrese secretly wed in February 2017</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Derek Blanks Photography</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Derek Blanks Photography</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Is This Khloé Kardashian’s Sexiest Maternity Photo Ever?
