We have to climb it together."</p><p>Even though the couple are still married, fans weren't pleased with Tyler's words in the old clip.</p><p>One fan posted in an online fan forum: "Tyler is a hypocrite. Neither of them finished college, correct?"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>A second said: "This is pretty rich considering I think he made it through like, one semester of community college?"</p><p>Yet a third fan slammed: "Tyler already thinks in this clip he's up here on the ladder and Cate's down below even though he ain't done anything, either.</p><p>"He will always think she's below him for their entire lives no matter what she does."</p><p>A fourth posted: "Listen to Tyler… like he’s about to start pre-med. Climb down from your high horse already!"</p><p>Although the pair- who now share three daughters- have been through their rough spots, after 13 years of dating they married back in 2015.</p><p>Catelynn and Tyler are now facing other problems beyond education.</p><h2><strong>CASH CRISIS</strong></h2><p>The U.S. Sun exclusively reported Catelynn and Tyler <a href=#>still owe over $321,000 in taxes</a> after the duo was slammed for begging fans for money.</p><p>Despite income from an upcoming <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> spinoff, the reality stars still owe $321,789.06.&nbsp;</p><p>They were hit with the federal tax lien back on December 16, 2019 for the 2018 year.</p><p>Catelynn and Tyler paid off a massive&nbsp;<a href=#>federal tax lien for $535,010.97</a>&nbsp;for the 2016 and 2017 years in 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>FAN BACKLASH</strong></h2><p>The tax debt comes as the parents of Carly, who they <a href=#>placed for adoption</a>, Novalee, Vaeda and Rya begged followers for cash.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, Catelynn posted a photo of a&nbsp;<a href=#>fundraising donation sign-up sheet</a>&nbsp;for Novalee's Tiny Tulip's cheerleading squad.</p><p>Catelynn explained in the caption: "Nova is looking for sponsors you can literally pick ANY number on this page and pay the number!"</p><p>She continued: "So if you pick number 20 then you would donate $20! The donations would help with uniforms, practice, and competitions!"</p><p>The TV personality concluded: "Anything helps thank you so much!... [I] can’t believe I’m gonna be a cheerleader mom."</p><p>Catelynn, who turned off the comments on the post,&nbsp;<a href=#>received backlash</a>.</p><p>One person wrote: "This is a very strange use of her platform. She and Tyler could afford to donate for Nova and [every] other kid on the team probably."</p><p>A second fan commented: "... Y’all should have plenty of money. Go sponsor another child. I’m honestly shook."</p><p>"This is just embarrassing and so cringe," another added.</p><h2>BUSINESSS VENTURES</h2><p>Tyler and Catelynn were once owners of children’s clothing business Tierra Reign, but the company has been inactive for over a year now.&nbsp;</p><p>Tyler also has flipped and sold homes, as he currently owns property in addition to the&nbsp;<a href=#>$220,000 Octagon-shaped home they currently live in</a>.</p><p>He also&nbsp;<a href=#>sold their Burtchville, Michigan home for $175,000</a>&nbsp;on October 29, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Tyler got more than his asking price, as he listed the home for $169,900 on June 26, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;star made a $101,560 profit, as he bought the home on March 7, 2016 for $73,440.&nbsp;</p><p>Teen Mom fans watched Catelynn pursue a career in microblading eyebrows, which she continues to do today.&nbsp;</p><p>The two also make income from the show and Instagram ads.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite their tax troubles, the reality stars fortunately have saved for their children.</p><p>Tyler revealed during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Awesome Dad Show</a>&nbsp;earlier this year that his&nbsp;<a href=#>daughters are “set up for life” financially</a>&nbsp;because of their compensation from the MTV series.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He said: “College is paid for and that was mine and Catelynn's main thing - each of our children has trust funds that money goes into and they can't touch."</p><p>Catelynn and&nbsp;Tyler will star in the upcoming new series&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/taken-without-permission-sweethearts-teen-mom-catelynn-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/cash-strapped-parents-teen-mom-catelynn-lowell-husband.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/taken-without-permission-sweethearts-teen-mom-catelynn-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYGmBeXyXaKuenZ5iurC5jK2wpZ2iYq%2BiuNOinKuqkWKwosDEpbCnpl2hvLixy6VknKecobKosYydrKaoXaKus77Inpto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./audreyana-michelles-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Audreyana Michelle Dating Audreyana Michelle's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-cruise-son-connor-sister-lee-nyc-rare-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rare Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
