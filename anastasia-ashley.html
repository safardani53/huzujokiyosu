Other than that, also active as a model, and she has attractive features like her dark brown hair and dark brown eyes.</p><h2>Professional Career- When did she start surfing?</h2><p>Talking about Ashley and her love for surfing, started early in her childhood. When she was just five years old, her family moved to Hawaii, and right after this, Ashley fell in love with surfing.</p><p>Since she had a passion and truly enjoyed riding the waves, it did not take her to master it.</p><p>Not to mention at the age of six, Ashley won a surf contest using a run-down board that she found in a trash can outside of her house. See what we said about passion!</p><p>Likewise, by seven, Ashley had sponsors to replace her old and trashed board with new ones.</p><p>Now, with financial support, Anastasia began thriving in her career as a surfer.

By September 2018, she was ranked 59th in the 2014 Women’s Qualification Series.&nbsp;</p><h2>Modeling and Other Ventures</h2><p>Anastasia is a gorgeous lady, and her skills are not limited to the waves only. Other than shredding the water on her surfboard, Anastasia also kills it in the magazines. The 5’7″ Ashley was featured in the October 2014 issue of Maxim magazine.</p><p>Also, in September 2014, Ashley started her own Gypsy Jet Set jewelry line in collaboration with OK1984, which is a jewelry company.</p><p>However, she did not let her modeling work divert her from her main passion. Along with the side jobs, Anastasia continued surfing and competing in some major competitions around the world.</p><p>As said, in November 2014, she went to Ireland for a Web Summit on how to maintain a competitive edge in surfing with a focus on social media tools. Not to mention, she was trying to convince <strong>Taoiseach Enda Kenny</strong> to surf as well.</p><p>Surfer and now a media personality, Anastasia also appeared in many television shows. She made her appearance on Season 14, the 3rd episode of Hell’s Kitchen.</p><p>There she taught the winners how to surf and later even attended as a guest in the dinner service segment.</p><p>Moreover, Ashley is also known for acting in various documentaries and movies. Some of her on-screen appearances were seen in shows like Isolated(2013), Air New Zealand Presents a Safety Safari(2015), and Naked and Afraid(2013).&nbsp;</p><h3>Naked and Afraid</h3><p>The thrilling reality program Naked and Afraid on Discovery Channel has two strangers (often a guy and a female) attempting to survive in the jungle for three weeks while completely naked. Ashley had a survivor appearance on the TV program Naked and Afraid in 2017. Even fish was seen being consumed by her.</p><p>Ashley had to endure the countless bug bites of living in outdoors. The worst event of my life, according to Ashley, was being assaulted by a swarm of newly hatched bugs that thought I was their host when I was nude in the jungle and had nowhere to hide. It was sheer suffering. To try to stop the itching, we longed to jump into the flames. We were fortunate not to, she said to Entertainment Weekly in 2017.</p><h2>Anastasia Ashley Wipeout</h2><p>Ashley was lucky to live after being struck in the back by a powerful 15-foot wave in 2014. In an interview with Grind TV, she was asked about the incident and responded, “Basically, I took the wrong line [laughs].</p><p>I was unaware of the location of the lip, and when I discovered it, I hesitated, which is when everything started to go horribly wrong. The lip simply exploded after landing directly on my back.</p><p>Ashley added that although she had previously been wiped out on other large waves, this one was by far the most traumatic. The worst-case scenario was another way she put it.</p><h2>Anastasia Ashley’s Personal Life- Who is she dating now? Boyfriend</h2><p>Already in her 30s, Anastasia is someone who is loved and admired by many. Stunning and smart on her own accord, Anastasia is no amateur when it comes to dating and having a relationship.</p><p>As of now, this successful surfer and model are dating a hunk, <strong>Abraham Kaslow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Unlike her, Anastasia’s current boyfriend is not a celebrity or public personality. Also, Kaslow is in the field of medicine and is also active as a model.</p><p>Despite being together and not being shy of public attention, they have yet to reveal when and how the two met in the first place. Likewise, Ashley also has revealed much about her relationship as well.</p><p>But don’t fret; the two are not married yet and revealed no plans of doing so anytime soon either.</p><p>Before this, Anastasia was in a couple of relationships. Her most known relationship was with <strong>Adam Taki,</strong> but for some reason, the two parted ways.</p><p>After that, she began dating another model, <strong>Sean Steward</strong>. However, this relationship also did not work, and the couple soon went their own ways.</p><p>Besides her relationship, Ashley loves spending time with her loved ones, something we got from her social media posts. Also, many might not know this; Ashley is a vegetarian who recently turned vegan.</p><p>Moreover, the American professional surfer posed for a PETA‘s vegetarian ad campaign back in 2006.</p><h3>Anastasia Ashley gets engaged to her boyfriend.</h3><p>Just when we thought Anastasia would never marry, she posted a photo on her Instagram with a ring on her finger. Yes, this American professional surfer is off the market as of now.</p><p>And well, it seems, the one who proposed to her is her boyfriend, Abraham Kaslow.</p><p>From what we know, Abraham and Anastasia got engaged in June 2019 during their vacation. Also, the two seemed to have the time of their lives in the posted pictures.</p><p>Likewise, Ashley posted the happy news with a caption that read, “YES!!! The LOVE OF MY LIFE <a class=notranslate href=#>@abraham_ster</a>&nbsp;PROPOSED TO ME LAST NIGHT ???&nbsp;<a class=xil3i href=#>#engaged</a>.”</p><p>Soon her comment section was flooded with congratulatory and heartfelt comments. With this, the couple is close to tying the knot, we suppose.</p><h2>How much does she make in a year?- Net Worth and Income</h2><p>Anastasia Ashley has been surfing since she was five years old. So to think she has continued doing so flawlessly is impressive on its own.</p><p>Thanks to her long career, success, might we add, has earned her fame and wealth. As of 2021, she has acquired a net worth of <strong>$3 million</strong> from her successful career.</p><p>Aside from that, Ashley also makes a yearly income of <strong>$0.5 million</strong>. We also have to consider that Ashley is also active as a model and media personality.
