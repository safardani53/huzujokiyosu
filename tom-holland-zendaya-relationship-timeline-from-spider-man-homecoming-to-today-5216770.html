As their characters Peter Parker and M.J.’s romance unfolded on screen, fans noticed that Tom and Zendaya’s off-screen relationship was changing in real time. Now that the world is aware that they’re together, the duo has made it clear that they want to protect their relationship from unwanted attention.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Our relationship is something that we are incredibly protective of and we want to keep as sacred as possible,” Tom told The Hollywood Reporter in June 2023. “We don’t think that we owe it to anyone, it’s our thing, and it has nothing to do with our careers.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Look through Zendaya and Tom’s full relationship timeline below.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>2016<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Zendaya and Tom first met in 2016 when she auditioned for the role of M.J. in <i>Spider Man: Homecoming</i>. After she was cast, the two quickly became friends once they bonded on set.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>2017</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@Zendaya</a> Does the press tour count 😂😝 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/2WsstZPyde</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>— Tom Holland (@TomHolland1996) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 13, 2017</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>After the first <i>Spider-Man</i> film premiered, the <i>Cherry</i> actor and the<i> Greatest Showman </i>actress were seen attending several public events together to promote their MCU movie. During their press tour, the best buds were always smiling and enjoying each other’s company alongside their other co-stars.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In 2017, <i>PEOPLE</i> reported that Tom and Zendaya were secretly dating and vacationed together, which they both vehemently denied.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“Wait wait … my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together HA! I haven’t been on a vacation in years. Hbu @TomHolland1996???” Zendaya tweeted that year, which Tom responded by writing, “Does the press tour count?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Later that year, Zendaya clarified to <i>Variety</i> that she was not dating Tom. “We are friends,” she noted. “He’s a great dude. He’s literally one of my best friends. This past how many months we’ve had to do press tours together. There’s very few people that will understand what that’s like at 20 years old</p><h2>2018</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tom-Holland-zendaya-relationship-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Throughout 2018, Tom and Zendaya were occasionally seen on social media sending supportive comments to each other. They also, however, jokingly bantered online, proving that their friendship was going strong.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>2019</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15><i>Spider-Man: Far From Home </i>premiered, and fans saw the pair share their first on-screen kiss together. Zendaya was reportedly romantically linked to her <i>Euphoria</i> co-star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Jacob Elordi</b></a>, which put romance rumors with Tom to rest for a while.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>2020</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Tom dated British actress <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Nadia Parkes</b></a> for a brief time in 2020, even including her on his Instagram account. It’s unclear when things between them fizzled out.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>2021</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>In July 2021, photos surfaced online capturing Tom and Zendaya sharing a kiss while on a drive throughout L.A. Two months later, the pair decided to make their romance Instagram official when Tom posted a sweet birthday tribute for his girlfriend, in which he famously called her, “My M.J.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-20>In November of that year, Tom spoke out against the photos of him and Zendaya kissing, which were taken without their knowledge. During his interview with <i>GQ</i>, the <i>Crowded Room</i> star noted, “One of the downsides of our fame is that privacy isn’t really in our control anymore, and a moment that you think is between two people that love each other very much is now a moment that is shared with the entire world. I’ve always been really adamant to keep my private life private, because I share so much of my life with the world anyway. We sort of felt robbed of our privacy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Zendaya agreed with her boyfriend while speaking with the publication. While reacting to the news of the viral photos, she called it “quite strange and weird and confusing and invasive.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-22>“The equal sentiment [we both share] is just that when you really love and care about somebody, some moments or things, you wish were your own,” the former Disney Channel star said. “I think loving someone is a sacred thing and a special thing and something that you want to deal with and go through and experience and enjoy amongst the two people that love each other.”</p><h2>2022</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/zendaya-tom-holland-in-love-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-23>Throughout 2022, the pair were seen in different corners of the world together, from the U.S. to England. However, after a report falsely claimed that Tom and Zendaya bought a house together in London, the <i>Impossible</i> actor laughed it off during an interview on <i>Live With Kelly and Ryan</i>. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-24>“I’ve had so many people call me up because, apparently, I bought a new house in South London? Which is completely false!” he said. “I didn’t buy a new house. I’m like, ‘Wow, what a surprise, I wonder when I’ll get the keys.’”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>2023</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tom holland and Zendaya spending Christmas with family 💗 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/VnkleGUiNP</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-25>— Damian ⛧ Cappi ✨taylors 3version3 (@cappiwrld) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 24, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-27>While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> in June 2023, Tom gave fans insight into Zendaya’s <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i> audition.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-28>“I was so blown away by how unique her performance was,” he noted. “And also just so interested in the fact that as soon as she left the room, there was a unanimous decision that she was our M.J. … And obviously, I’m very happy that she came in and tested that day. I’m sure you can guess why.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-29>Tom also said that Zendaya is “wonderful to work with” and is “arguably the most talented person I’ve ever met.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OopGagn6G5orrDZrGeppSWxqJ50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZK2hnZq5qrrEZp2rp51iwLG1w56pZqWRo3qpu8yemqilmaO0bsDOZquonJGuenZ%2BkG9ucGhf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./francia-raisas-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Francia Raisa Dating Francia Raisa's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sedona-prince-rylee-leglue-cheating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sedona Prince Responds To Ex Rylee LeGlues Cheating Claims</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
