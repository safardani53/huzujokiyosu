Players spin the wheel and whatever dollar amount they land on, determines how much their guesses will be worth. So, if someone lands on $600 and they guess a correct letter, they earn $600 for every instance it appears in the puzzle.</p><p>The point of the game is to rack up as much cash as you can across several rounds of spinning and guessing and toss-up puzzles.</p><p>Contestants can accumulate enormous cash amounts between actual money earned and whatever other prizes they might be able to pick up. But the ultimate goal is to make sure your cash amount is the highest out of the three players for the chance to win even bigger prizes in the Bonus Round.</p><p>And whether the contestant in the Bonus Round wins or loses, they can still go home with the money they earned — after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taxes</a>, albeit.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC/Eric McCandless</span></figure><p>While that's basically good news for the contestant in the Bonus Round, what about the other two contestants? After all, it couldn't have been easy to get chosen out of so many applicants to appear on the show, and it would all feel like such wasted effort if you didn't get to the Bonus Round.</p><p>Fortunately enough, they don't exactly go home empty-handed. Wheel of Fortune contestants each go home with their winnings, and even if they don't solve a single puzzle, they still receive a consolation prize of $1,000 just for appearing on the show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Wheel of Fortune (@wheeloffortune)</a></p></figure><p>However, don't expect your winnings right away.
