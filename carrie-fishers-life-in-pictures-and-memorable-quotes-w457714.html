She left behind a legacy that friends and fans alike will never forget.</p><p>She is survived by daughter<a href=#><strong> Billie Lourd</strong> </a>(whose father is <a href=#>Fisher’s ex-husband <strong>Bryan Lourd</strong></a>), who reflected on her late mother’s legacy in May 2023 when Fisher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>“I wanted to hate [Star Wars] so I could tell her how lame she was,” the <a href=#>Scream Queens</a> alum admitted while <a href=#>accepting the honor</a> on her mother’s behalf at the Los Angeles ceremony. “Like any kid, I didn’t want my mom to be hot or cool — she was my mom. But that day, staring at the screen, I realized no one is, or will ever be, as hot or as cool as Princess Leia.”</p><p>In addition to watching the films that made her mother a household name, attending fan conventions changed Billie’s perspective.</p><p>“People of all ages from all over the world were dressed up like my mom, the lady who sang me to sleep at night and held me when I was scared. Watching the amount of joy it brought to people when she hugged them or threw glitter at them — sorry about that — was incredible to witness,” Billie recalled. “People waited in line for hours just to meet her. People had tattoos of her, people named their children after her. People had stories of how she saved their lives. It was a side of my mom I had never seen before, and it was magical.”</p><p>The actress — who went on to star alongside her mother in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi — continued: “I realized then that Leia is more than just a character. She is a feeling. She is strength. She is grace. She is wit. She is femininity at its finest. She knows what she wants and she gets it. She doesn’t need anyone to rescue her because she rescues herself and even rescues the rescuers. And no one could have played her like my mother.”</p><p>Beyond Fisher’s legacy as Leia, her daughter <a href=#>is proud of her impact</a> on those struggling with addiction and mental health. In addition to her acting work, Fisher was a prolific writer. She opened up about her personal struggles in her memoirs, including Wishful Drinking and The Princess Diarist.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“One of my favorite quotes of hers is, ‘Take your broken heart and make it into art.’ And she did just that,” Billie shared at the Walk of Fame ceremony. “And I hope to pass that torch — or in this case, lightsaber — of wisdom on to the next generation of fans. Take your broken heart and make it into art.”</p><p>Scroll down for more of Fisher’s iconic photos and quotes:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKK%2B0aKcZp6ZqLWmvtJmo6KelWK2r3nPopqtraKawG6tzZ1kpp2dpL%2BirsueZKqtn6mytHnWbWxwb2FpfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kourtney-kardashian-nude-bikini-lemme-campaign-pregnancy-comment-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kourtney Kardashian Dons Nude Bikini &amp;amp; Claps Back At Pregnancy Comment Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-sheltons-healing-in-the-heartland-relief-benefit-concert-2013295.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Shelton's Benefit Concert for Oklahoma</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
