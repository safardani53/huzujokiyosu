For the past few years, MJ has been the host of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL Total Access</a>, one of the premiere shows on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL Network</a>.</p><p>More recently, though, many fans noticed that MJ was no longer appearing as the show's regular host, which naturally left them wondering whether MJ had left the network altogether.

Instead, it seems that MJ has transitioned to a more general role with the NFL Network that will allow her to appear in various capacities across a number of different programs.</p><p>"Entering Season 6 with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@nflnetwork</a> and it will look different my friends," MJ wrote in August, ahead of the start of this season.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"While my @NFLTotalAccess chapter has come to a close, you will see me on your TV and across @NFL @NFLMedia platforms. I’m excited to share what’s ahead!" she added.</p><p>MJ hasn't posted any additional information about her role change, and it's currently unclear whether this is something that she asked for or something that was foisted upon her by the network. Either way, though, MJ is still with the NFL Network.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some fans are not happy about the shift.</h2><p>Although MJ was transparent about the scheduling shift, many people are not thrilled with the news that she will no longer be the host of Total Access, and they weren't afraid to make their voices heard in the comments under her post.</p><p>"That's a huge mistake, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@nflnetwork</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#MJAcosta</a> was incredibly knowledgeable passionate, and phenomenal as the host!
