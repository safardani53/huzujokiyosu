Although Chastain and Robinson, 42, admitted to hooking up between seasons, they <a href=#>chose to dodge any more questions on the topic</a> in the past.</p><p>Before the Florida native announced her pregnancy, the chef exclusively told Us Weekly in September 2021 that <a href=#>he had “no regrets” about his past romance</a> with Chastain. <a href=#>The</a> <a href=#>Traitors</a> star, for her part, joked that she didn’t “really remember” taking that step in her relationship with Robinson.</p><p>In December 2022, Chastain surprised her followers when she <a href=#>announced that she was expecting a baby</a>, writing via Instagram, “I’m already planning so many birthday theme parties for you 💗💙💗💙.”</p><p>The TV personality noted that <a href=#>she had plans to raise her baby on her own</a>. “I’m doing it solo and perhaps with some help, but I’m happy to do it alone,” she explained during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen at the time. “I think being a chief stew really trained me for it.”</p><p>Chastain later elaborated on her decision to <a href=#>keep some details of her pregnancy private.</a></p><p>“It is a happy miracle, and I would love to share every detail [about] how it happened and everything, but I think I’m going to be a good mom because I’m realizing, like, this is not just my information,” she told Entertainment Tonight in February. “Like, my unborn child, one day, will have access to the internet and we’ll be able to Google, and I just feel like it’s not just my information to share.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One month <a href=#>before Chastain gave birth</a>, the England native took to social media to<a href=#> gush about the next chapter in his friend’s life.</a></p><p>“Who knew that Kate Chastain and I would be the same weight one day… But to be fair I have been hitting the gym! Please wish my great friend @kate_chastain an easy delivery and a healthy beautiful baby! I am so proud of who you have become and the mother you will soon be❤️,” Robinson, who recently reunited with Chastain on screen for Below Deck‘s Galley Talk, wrote via Instagram in April alongside a photo of the duo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabnZykxG6wxJyirGWblsGmecKhmKyskZ67br7Er5yapKNixKmx06Gcq2WSmrtutdJmn56qXai8r7%2BMn5itoJWnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniella-karagach-19921226-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniella Karagach (Dancer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-foley.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Foley- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
