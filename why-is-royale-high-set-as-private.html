It's a massively popular part of <a href=#>Roblox</a> where users join up to pretend they're attending a magical school to become royalty, fairies, mermaids, and a variety of other magical creatures. It's been in play since 2017, when it originally debuted as Fairies and Mermaids Winx High School. Now, it's been made private in Roblox, so no one is allowed to play. This is leaving players pretty concerned.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, while Royale High is marked as private, you won't be able to log in and get up to your usual escapades with fans. But there's no reason to be alarmed or scared about your account. This is not localized to any one account. There's no need for worry. In fact, you can rest assured it'll be coming back for everyone to jump back in soon enough. It's shut down and marked as private currently because there's a current problem that may well wipe your account. Here's what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why 'Royale High' in 'Roblox' is currently set to private</h2><p>Royale High is currently set to private due to a glitch that's going on within Roblox. There have been issues noted on Reddit by people trying to enjoy the game who have lost all of their progress and saved games. This appears to have been brought on by playing specific games within Roblox. It looks like Royale High was one of them. Precautions were put in place to protect players.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's to ensure the safety of player data," wrote Reddit user 11037DidIt. "You have a much lower chance of losing data when the game is shut down. This has been done by Roblox themselves so they can figure out what the issue is. It's a good thing for everyone, since no one wants to lose their progress. Hopefully, no one has already been affected, nor will they be in the foreseeable future, and it will all get back to normal very soon."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Right now, the best course of action is to play the game as you normally would and find another way to occupy yourself. There are plenty of different games to experiment with in Roblox if you decide to poke around and see what's out there. By the time this game is resolved, you may even have found a new title that gets you excited!</p><p>At least you're not wandering into Royale High and losing all your save progress inadvertently because you didn't know there was a problem. Working for everything you have in a game and then subsequently losing it has to be one of the worst feelings ever, so thankfully the game creators and mods have kept it from happening to all the potentially vulnerable users. Here's to the game being made available here in the near future so it doesn't have to stay closed for the very foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKunqZa5pnnHop6hZaOawW6t0manq6GmlsGm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-evermore-songs-meaning-joe-alwyn-4279851.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Full Guide To All The Songs On the Album Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-was-leslie-griffith.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who was Leslie Griffith? | The US Sun</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
