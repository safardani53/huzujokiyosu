What's he doing on TV?' and Mum was like, 'He's an actor. That's what he does.'"</p><p>While both his parents enjoyed huge screen success – with dad picking up two Oscars for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump - Chet was kept away from the acting industry until he was 17 when he landed a small part in Bratz.</p><p>And he called his parents the “best people ever”, adding: “I love my parents so, so much. They did a really good job raising me. Great dad, great mum. I'm extremely blessed just to have great parents.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552382570-e1578409074811.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552382554.jpg><h2>Off the rails...into rehab</h2><p>Although he landed minor roles in his teens, including in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and his dad’s directorial debut Larry Crowne, Chet dreamed of a rap career.</p><p>While studying at Northwestern College, in 2011, he adopted the name of Chet Haze and released White and Purple - a cover of Whiz Khalifa’s Black and Yellow changed to his college colours.</p><p>But he was already battling a drug addiction that had begun when he was 16, and was taking increasing amounts of cocaine and, after graduating, Chet started to gain notoriety for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>In November 2014, &nbsp;he opened up about his eight-year drug addiction after a stint in rehab, saying: “Finally at the age of 24 I decided to get some help. With 50 days of sobriety under my belt, I can honestly say I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552382563-e1578409528318.jpg><h2>Trashing a hotel room and posing with guns</h2><p>But just three months later, in February 2017, his parents were sued by a driver who claimed he was ‘under the influence’ when he rear-ended him in the couple’s Chevrolet, although no arrest was made.</p><p>That July, after drinking champagne and vodka in a London club, he caused £1,200 worth of damage to a four-star hotel room in London's Gatwick airport, ripping the TV from the wall and leaving smashed glass strewn across the floor.</p><p>"He was pretty obnoxious once he started drinking at the club. He kept saying 'do you know who I am?'” one clubgoer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mirror</a>, and hotel guests at the Arora International complained he was “loud and obnoxious” during his stay.</p><p>The same month, he was pictured posing with two hand guns on Instagram and he caused a huge backlash with a series of Instagram posts about his new track Juice, where he defended his use of the n-word.</p><p>He claimed he used the offensive term with the “black friends who get me” and added: “The way I see it, it’s a word that unifies the culture of HIP-HOP across ALL RACES, which is actually kind of a beautiful thing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552382793.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552382560.jpg><h2>'Snorted so much coke my nose clogged'</h2><p>Shortly after the posts, Chet’s social media accounts went silent prompting bizarre rumours he had been kidnapped, but in October 2015, he put his worried followers straight.</p><p>“I just want to let you all know, I've been in rehab... and I'm doing pretty damn good," he said, in an Instagram video.</p><p>"A couple months ago I was selling coke, doing coke until I couldn't even snort it up my nose anymore because it was so clogged.</p><p>"I even smoked crack. If I can change, you can change. There is a solution."</p><p>This time the reformed addict stayed sober, throwing himself into gym workouts and his passion for dirt bikes.</p><p>He also began to get his career on track, landing recurring roles in Shameless and Empire, for which he also recorded the track How Ya Luv That.</p><p>Throughout his addiction, his parents stood by him</p><p>“As a parent, you love your kids unconditionally,” Tom told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>. “You support them every step of the way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552382787-e1578410033442.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552382403.jpg><h2>Daughter 'saved my life'</h2><p>It was a lesson that Chet was about to take on board, when he became dad to Michaiah, born April 2016.</p><p>The doting dad credits his daughter – with partner Tiffany Miles – for keeping him clean.</p><p>"There's a part of you that knows that you need to make a change, but you can't really shut the door on your life and just move on to a new chapter.</p><p>“For me, it took something drastic happening, like becoming a father," Chet told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2018.</p><p>In December 2017, Chet shared a photo of him with his daughter, writing: "The best part of my year.
