According to the court documents, Baumgartner stated that the pair separated on April 11. They are seeking joint physical and legal custody of their children: sons Cayden, 15, and Logan, 14, and daughter Grace 12.

[She] wanted a child, but I was afraid I couldn’t be an effective father,” the director recalled to&nbsp;Closer Weekly&nbsp;in June 2018. “I woke up and thought, ‘Am I going to lose a beautiful woman who is willing to be with me to my very last breath because I am afraid to say yes to a child?’ That’s all it took. Sometimes you learn the thing you’re most afraid of will save your life.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Costner later got candid about what he considers the secret to a successful marriage. “I know that sounds so simple. If you’re willing to tell somebody that you love them, are you also willing to say you’re sorry? You need to, even when you think you’re in the right,” he told Parade in May 2012.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknaaeu26vzqyrp52iqHqmxIycn6uho6m2r7GMrJiyq12dsm64xKCYpaSpYrCiutNmoqKbm2K1pr6MpKCdq12kwrV7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./love-island-ella-family-first-met-tyrique-outside.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Love Island star Ella's family reveal what really happened when she met Tyrique before the show</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jordyn-woods-accused-of-buying-body-transformation-claps-back-ov.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jordyn Woods Accused of &amp;quot;Buying&amp;quot; Body Transformation, Claps Back Over Fitness Journey</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
