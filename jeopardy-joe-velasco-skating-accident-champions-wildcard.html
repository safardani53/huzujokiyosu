Fortunately for him, Robert closed strongly to prevent Morgan from the runaway."</p><p>Another sweetly penned: "So excited for Joe and his charity for brown and black figure skaters."</p><h2>'NEARLY BLED OUT ON THE ICE'</h2><p>Joe wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> in 2020, sharing a selfie of the scar on his wrist and describing what happened [seen above].</p><p>He wrote: “My Jeopardy! win on Sept 17 was more significant than most realize."</p><p>“For those who know I grew up figure skating, you may have heard about a horrific accident I sustained on the ice.</p><p>“As I felt myself landing incorrectly on a difficult jump, I reached my right hand down to stop myself from falling hard.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of you know how flexible I am, but where sharp blades are involved, extreme flexibility isn't always a safe quality to have.</p><p>“Meanwhile, my left leg whipped around behind me and the left blade came to a stop IN THE BONE OF MY RIGHT WRIST.</p><p>"I severed arteries, nerves, and almost every tendon. I nearly bled out on the ice.</p><p>He continued: “They had donor blood prepared and ready for me at the hospital. After a six-hour surgery, I was saved.</p><p>“After a series of casts and months of occupational therapy, I had practically full, functional use again.</p><p>“I'll never be able to feel with my right index finger & thumb anymore, but that's no disability.</p><p>"I PHYSICALLY healed by 6 months, and was practically back to my full strength in that hand after a year.”</p><p>“The problem was healing emotionally. A serious trauma like that will always remain in the back of your mind.</p><p>"That's even after years of therapy and sports psychology. It's torture to have a hobby that you LOVE so much but have it TERRIFY you. At times the fear was CRIPPLING.
