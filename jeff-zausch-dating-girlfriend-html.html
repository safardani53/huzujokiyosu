She is a musician and a traveler. Like him, she is also an outdoor and travel enthusiast.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During a 2021&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook live</a>, the couple revealed she watched his survival shows before they met through Munoz's cousin. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>The cousin was Zausch's cameraman, and he&nbsp;introduced them to each other. Soon, they bonded through their common interest in wildlife and started dating.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Zausch couldn't help but rave about his girlfriend in the live session. He acknowledged her part during his recent back-to-back survival challenges, sharing she supported and helped him sustain the wildlife with her skills.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"She is amazing. So yeah like you said, she helped me get through. That's crazy to think about," Zausch shared as he pointed out she helped him for 134 days out of 195. He even added that finding her was the best luck of his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As the couple was talking about each other, a fan complimented Munoz, saying she was the 'real G.O.A.T.'&nbsp;Zausch laughingly agreed with the viewer and said she was the greatest of all time.</p><h2>Jeff Zausch's Divorce From Wife</h2><p><span>Before his public relationship with Munoz, Zausch was married to Gabrielle Zausch. The couple tied the knot on March 8, 2013.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span>He used to post about her and their camping trips often on his social media&nbsp;but revealed little details about her and their relationship. The last time he made a post with his wife was back in 2015.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After that, it seems like the two divorced and parted ways. That's because Zausch started posting pictures with his new girlfriend.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=image-align-center><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Jeff Zausch's wife before he started dating his girlfriend Erin Munoz. </strong>(Photo: Jeff Zausch/ <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>Even today, the lovebirds often post pictures of hikes and date nights with movies.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span>Usually, after Zausch's survival trips, they take some time off for vacation. In February 2020, the couple went to the Bahamas to recover from an intense challenge.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He revealed he chose the location to relax with Munoz after a very off-the-grid challenge. He said he needed time to prepare for the next challenge.&nbsp;</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Apart from being supportive, Zausch also credits his girlfriend for making him happy. On March 20, 2022, he celebrated the International Day of happiness with his girlfriend and pet dog, Beck.</p><p>"I just wanted to celebrate with you all and share a little photo of what brings me the greatest happiness,"&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he captioned</a>, with pictures of them three in Yellowstone with his arms around Munoz and Beck.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKVm7NuxsCuqpygXZmutbXNoGSgoaKhs7O1xKebZ6Ckork%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-friend-lala-anthony-never-marry-again-divorce.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian's best friend LaLa Anthony says she'll NEVER marry again after 'really hard' divorce</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ricky-gervais-vegan-vegetarian-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Ricky Gervais vegan?
