Her infectious hit 2015 track "Ex's & Oh's" made her a bonafide star, and in the years since Elle has gone on to deliver a slew of other fan-favorite tracks which have proven her versatility and staying power in the industry.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Aside from her successes in music, Elle has been seeing some success in her personal life as of late too. That begs the question: is Elle married? Furthermore, does she have any children?

However, she is happily engaged to her fiancé, Dan Tooker. For those who don't know, Dan is a tattoo artist who works with Riverside Tattoo Co., evident by his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. He appears to mainly specialize in American traditional tattoos and has a fairly extensive portfolio of work posted to his profile.</p><p>The duo dated for one year before Dan decided to propose to Elle in 2020, and it seems as though it went down in a really special way.</p><p>Sharing images of the moment the question was popped, Elle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on Instagram, "Today is our one-year anniversary. We rode horses up a mountain to go gold panning. I had a ring in my pocket and I was going to toss it in the gold pan and propose to @tattooker ... but of course, my soulmate beat me to the punch and proposed to me the exact same way."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She concluded with, "So I immediately got down on my knee too. I love you Daniel. One year down, forever to go. I said yes by the way, and so did he!"</p><p>Although the proposal happened over two years ago, Elle and Dan still haven't appeared to have an official marriage ceremony.</p><p>Prior to Dan, Elle was married to Andrew Ferguson from 2016 to 2017. She was also engaged to a previous boyfriend named Jim back in 2019, but that relationship dissolved before they could tie the knot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Elle King have any children?</h2><p>Elle and Dan may not have officially tied the knot just yet, but that doesn't mean that the two haven't taken other steps to establish their family. On Sept. 5, 2021, Elle took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to announce to the world that she and Dan welcomed to her first child, a son named Lucky Levi Tooker.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Very proud to announce the birth of our son, Lucky Levi Tooker.

The singer wrote at the time, alongside an adorable photo of herself, Dan, and Lucky embracing.</p><p>In the time since, it appears as though Lucky has hit the road with his famous mom, appearing at performances of hers like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> that she shared in July 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmtsYykoKefXaKus77Inps%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeet-dass-girlfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeet Dass Girlfriend: Who is Jeet Das Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rust-cinematographers-husband-addresses-wifes-death-in-today-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Halyna Hutchins' Husband Talks About Wife's Death for First Time on Today</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
