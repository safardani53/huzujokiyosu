It's about them now, it's not about us.</p><p>“20 years ago we did what we needed to do and got all of that out of our system and now it's a new era - and that's our kids. Some of our kids haven't seen what we do."</p><p>“It's only my little girl who has seen what we do - and she's 25 now.”</p><p>Simon has daughters Alanah, 25, and Cyan, seven months, while <a href=#>Duncan James</a> has 16-year-old daughter Tianie Finn.</p><p>Lee Ryan became a dad for a third time in June when he welcomed a daughter, adding to his brood of kids Bluebell, 14, and Rayn, 13.</p><p>Meanwhile <a href=#>Antony Costa</a> has daughters Emilie, 17, Savannah Rosa, seven, and Paloma Valentina, four.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>Duncan added: “There will probably be a baby crèche on the road this time.<br>“We've got the new generation of Blue coming through - you can set up a girl band.”</p><p>The group, who this week are marking 20 years since their debut album All Rise, said the tour is all the more poignant for them following the death of their friend Sarah Harding, who would have been celebrating 20 years with Girls Aloud next year.</p><p>Duncan said: “I just finished The Real Full Monty which was a huge thing because not only did I have to strip, but actually the biggest thing was about cancer.</p><p>“The statistic is one in two people will get cancer. The Wanted came onto the show as well and Tom Parker is suffering with a brain tumour, bless him, and it just made me have a moment of like, 'Oh my God, we're in a four-piece, does that mean two of us are going to get cancer?</p><p>“It's a really scary thing to think about.</p><p>It's only my little girl who has seen what we do - and she's 25 now</p><span class=quote-credit>Simon Webbe</span><p>“You think of Sarah who sadly lost her battle with cancer and it's really scary.</p><p>“This moment of us getting back together now is even more poignant for us and thank God we're all healthy and have the ability to be able to get back on stage and do what we love to do.</p><p>“We can't take anything for granted anymore, especially in the current situation in the world.”</p><p>Their Heart & Soul Tour will kick off in Belfast on September 11, accompanied by special guests Atomic Kitten. Tickets will go on sale this Friday.</p><p>The lads have also teased there could be new music for the shows.<br>Simon said: “I'd like to say we are always recording, we've always got ideas, whether we're going to marry it up with the 20th anniversary, we're not sure.”</p><p>All four members have been declared bankrupt in the past and admitted they are getting back on the road again for the money.</p><p>When asked what they would say to someone who suggested they are only touring for the cash, Simon replied: Well, who doesn't? This is our job.”</p><p>Antony said: “We're entitled to earn money - we've got bills to pay.”</p><p>Insisting it isn’t just for them, Lee added: “It's not just about us making money, there's a whole team behind us. It's generating jobs for other people.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000697128123.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000677588221.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000002560858.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>HAILEY'S A STUNNER</h2><p>HAILEY BIEBER came up smelling of roses at a fashion party in Miami.</p><p>She wore this bold floral jumpsuit while out with singer <a href=#>Zoe Kravitz</a> despite being in mourning for <a href=#>Virgil Abloh</a>, the designer behind the dress she wore when she married singer hubby <a href=#>Justin</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03c69728-5c80-4604-b0d6-e8e5841122dc.jpg><p><a href=#>Hailey</a> was among a slew of celebrities, including <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, <a href=#>Drake</a> and <a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a>, who paid tribute to Virgil, whose death was announced on Sunday following a secret cancer battle.</p><p>In an emotional message online, Hailey wrote: “Virgil completely changed the way I looked at street style and fashion. The way he looked at things inspired me deeply.</p><p>“I will never be able to fully express how grateful I am to have known him and worked with him.</p><p>"From walking on his runways to having him design my wedding dress and all the other amazing moments in between, I felt he was always rooting for me.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ROD FIRES A ROCKET</h2><p><a href=#>ROD STEWART</a> has stirred the pot with his old rival <a href=#>Elton John</a>, this time taking a pop at Rocketman, the 2019 biopic about Elt.</p><p>He reckons it paled in comparison to the Freddie Mercury film Bohemian Rhapsody, which came out the year before with Rami Malek as the Queen frontman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000696706277.jpg><p>And Rod suggested a possible film based on his music would be better, as it could feature his own flesh and blood.</p><p>Asked about Elton’s movie, he told music newsletter The New Cue: “It was OK. I think where it went wrong was that it was just after Freddie’s film, which was so unbelievable.</p><p>“And it was also squeezed in between A Star Is Born. That was incredible too. They all sort of came out at the same time.”</p><p>Of a possible Rod Stewart movie, he added: “I want that to happen. We’re working on it, that’s all I can tell you. My 18-year- old son wants to play me at 18. I could get my other son playing me when I was ten.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>LUC AWAY, JESY</h2><p><a href=#>JESY NELSON </a>should look away now.</p><p>Just 48 hours after the singer was snapped cosying up to actor <a href=#>Lucien Laviscount</a> on a night out in London, he appears to have moved on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000697002224-1.jpg><p>I told yesterday how sources close to Jesy insisted their date was a one-off thing.</p><p>And Lucien certainly isn’t dwelling on it, being pictured late on Monday linking arms with former Hollyoaks actress <a href=#>Wallis Day</a>.</p><p>The pair couldn’t stop smiling at the Tommy Hilfiger after-party following The Fashion Awards in the capital.</p><p>Jesy sang on her solo debut about liking bad boys. Perhaps she’ll go for a nice one after this.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Shawn breaks silence</h2><p><a href=#>CAMILA CABELLO</a> poured her pain into music after breaking up with <a href=#>Shawn Mendes</a> a fortnight ago.</p><p>Now he’s doing the same. Shawn will drop a song at midnight tonight titled It’ll Be Okay.</p><p>In a teaser posted online last night, he sings: “Are we gonna make it? Is this gonna hurt?”</p><p>So much for those matching statements saying their “love for one another as humans is stronger than ever”.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>BUSY MO SETTING HIS SIGHTS ON BIG SCREEN</h2><p>HE is a comedian, has been a judge on ITV’s The Masked Singer and will host the Brit Awards next February, now <a href=#>Mo Gilligan</a> is planning yet another career move – this time getting into movies.</p><p>The funnyman said: “I would love to do acting and films eventually. It is an ambition of mine but I want to do the right thing and I also want to earn the role for myself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695899526.jpg><p>“I don’t want to be typecast and just play the funny man as the token funny guy. I want to try different acting roles and get the role because of my acting skills and because I auditioned like everyone else.”</p><p>But it will be hard keeping any potential jobs secret, as he is always being asked about exciting projects in the pipeline.</p><p>Mo added: “It’s just everyone wanting to know what’s next. There’s pressure to do something all the time. It’s important to chill and have some me time as well. People are always asking me what I’m working on and sometimes it’s like, ‘Nothing, I’m just on holiday, man’.”</p><p>He also revealed his greatest supporters. Mo explained: “My family are my biggest fans. Whenever I have shows all the family want to come along. I seem to have a lot more cousins lately who I’ve not seen for a while.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ADELE’S BIG U-TURN ON VEGAS GIGS</h2><p>THIS is your weekly reminder not to believe everything celebs spout off about.</p><p>Just three weeks ago, <a href=#>Adele</a> said performing live is currently “too unpredictable” due to Covid and that she wouldn’t be doing a major tour as “I don’t want anyone coming to my show scared. And I don’t want to get <a href=#>Covid</a>”.</p><p>Asked about a Las Vegas residency – heavily rumoured for months – she said of the venues in Sin City: “There’s f***ing nothing available.”</p><p>So imagine my eye-rolling yesterday when she suddenly decided she will launch a residency in Nevada next month. Her show, Weekends With Adele, will be at Caesars Palace Hotel from January 21.</p><p>These things take months and sometimes years in the planning, so it looks like Adele was saving the news just so she could announce it on Instagram.</p><p>Apart from anything else, the tickets are bound to be extortionate so I imagine most people would have liked notice to save up.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Olivia is stream queen</h2><p><a href=#>OLIVIA RODRIGO</a> has been crowned Apple Music’s most successful artist in this country over the past year.
