This is all alot for me, I just found out one hour ago. My head is scrambled, i’m panicking bad."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>REDDIT TO THE RESCUE</h2><p>Several people took to the comments to help out the poster.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>One recommended that the user look into Charles Schwab or <a href=#>Capital One</a> 360 to set up a new checking account.</p><p>They mentioned that the former bank may even DHL the user a debit card to Brazil for a small fee.</p><p>They also noted that PayPal, Venmo, and Wise have debit cards but that they don't recommend using them internationally due to fees.</p><p>In response, the user mentioned that they just did an application for both <a href=#>Bank of America</a> and <a href=#>PNC</a>, but that the former already declined them and that the latter takes two days.</p><p>They asked: "Any place I should try? I just need a checking account that I can use to hold my cash and transfer to other apps for credit card payments, bills and uber etc."</p><p>Another Redditor chimed in, explaining how the user might have an issue if the banks look at their IP address in Brazil and subsequently flag the application, resulting in it being denied or not processed.</p><p>They proceeded to answer the user's question about opening an account remotely.</p><p>"Some institutions now have online banking, where you can video call in to open an account, or call via the phone (if you use Google voice over WiFi, it's free to call a US number). I know plenty of credit unions in my area offer video branch services."</p><p>Like the first Redditor offering advice, this one likewise suggested that the user look into Schwab.</p><p>They recommended using Schwab for a travel account, again stating that the bank may send them a debit card to Brazil.</p><p>They noted that it might not be possible, as: "When it's your first card typically it has to go to the address on file."</p><p>The person asked if the Schwab application is difficult to pass, mentioning their low credit score and unpaid debts.</p><p>"You can always try and see. If you're denied, look into one of the credit unions or banks in your area with a second chance account," said the Redditor in response.</p><p>Read the full thread <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Read about the <a href=#>banking customer</a> that had their account closed by Chase and then Bank of America.</p><p>Also read on <a href=#>Chase</a> closing a customer's account over fraud and then admitting it was by mistake – but their money is still missing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfboZygpRwaGibmJbApnnBmqWkZZOhvLSxw2aYnJufqru1ecCbqaiZlGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heather-gay-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'RHOSLC' Star Heather Gay Is a Single Mom Whose Net Worth Is Pretty Impressive</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-mia-regan-romeo-beckham-ex-girlfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Romeo Beckham's girlfriend Mia Regan?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
