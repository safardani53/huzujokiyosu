A few years later, his family relocated to a nearby town called Crawford. Rice’s father was a brick mason.</p><p>Whereas his mother’s occupation remains in the dark. The Mississippi-born enrolled in B.L. Moor High School in Oktoc, Mississippi, U.S.</p><p>At an early age, Jerry was passionate about football. However, his mother was skeptical and prohibited Rice from playing football.</p><p>It was up to fate to step in. One day the school’s principal noticed Jerry’s frequent absence.</p><p>When the principal confronted Rice, he sprinted away with such a pace that the headmaster consulted the football coach to place him on the team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jerry-576.jpg><p>The Mississippian engaged in other sports like basketball and track and field to build stamina. After moving to Mississippi Valley State Valley University, Rice was a first-choice receiver and could catch anything thrown at him.</p><p>Together with fellow teammate <strong>Willie Toten,</strong> both became prominent as “The Satellite Express.” Their record was awe-inspiring, and they made a mark in the NCAA.</p><p>In Division I-AA, he set a record in 1983 and the next year broke it himself.</p><p>The two players were so phenomenal that the school named the stadium “Rice-Toten Stadium” to honor their best players.</p><p>Rice’s record-breaking, sensational performance got noticed by many NFL scouts. Ultimately 49ers signed him.</p><h3>Excellence Is More Than A Practice</h3><p>Jerry Rice is best known for his unwavering consistency, hard work, and dedication. Even when it comes to his workout routine, he was famous for his hustle on the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Often, Jerry would be the last one to leave the training.</p><p>He conducted his own six-day-a-week off-season workouts.</p><p>During his workout days, he would devote his mornings to cardiovascular work, five-mile trail, and wind sprints.&nbsp;</p><p>Following it, he would do his weight training in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jerry Rice Net Worth | Career Earnings, Endorsements, & Businesses</h2><p>With a career ranging from the Francisco 49ers, and Oakland Raiders to Seattle Seahawks, the American earned a close <strong>$42.4 million</strong> in his 20 years long career. Rice’s net worth would increase significantly if he signed with the Denver Broncos.</p><p>Nonetheless, his decision to retire didn’t stop him from earning a little extra cash. On the other hand, the wide receiver pocketed a signing record of a <strong>$4 million</strong> bonus.</p><p>Likewise, Jerry made a <strong>$1.6 million salary</strong>, cashing in a <strong>$5.6 million</strong> total pay in 1996.</p><p>The NFL star started with a base salary of <strong>$700 k</strong> and ended his career with <strong>$876,470</strong>. In addition, the American averaged a median wage of<strong> $2 million</strong> throughout his playing tenure.</p><p>Jerry’s career highlight was sure to follow him in retirement. Subsequently, the former receiver was featured in several media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jerry-Rose-Net-Worth.jpg><p>In the same way, Rice was part of Visa, All Sport, and Gatorade.</p><p>In like manner, the former NFL player appeared in Dancing with the Stars, pairing with <strong>Anna Trebunskaya,</strong> and even reached the finals.</p><p>Rice delved into acting with the movie Without a Paddle: Nature’s Calling and the sitcom Rules of Engagement.</p><p>Apart from these, the retired player co-authored the book Rice and Go Long: My Journey Beyond the Game and the Fame. As of recent, Rice co-hosted Sports Sunday, broadcasted in San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Notwithstanding, Jerry actively supports the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress. Above all, the 61-year-old established and endorsed several organizations like Jerry Rice 127 Foundation, National Kidney Foundation, and Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p><h2>Jerry Rice | Career Stats</h2><table width=500><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Team</strong></td><td><strong>G</strong></td><td><strong>Rec</strong></td><td><strong>Yds</strong></td><td><strong>Avg</strong></td><td><strong>TD</strong></td><td><strong>Att</strong></td><td><strong>Yds</strong></td><td><strong>Avg</strong></td><td><strong>TD</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1985</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>49</td><td>927</td><td>18.9</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>26</td><td>4.3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1986</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>86</td><td>1,570</td><td>18.3</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>72</td><td>7.2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1987</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>12</td><td>65</td><td>1,078</td><td>16.6</td><td>22</td><td>8</td><td>51</td><td>6.4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1988</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>64</td><td>1,306</td><td>20.4</td><td>9</td><td>13</td><td>107</td><td>8.2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>82</td><td>1,483</td><td>18.1</td><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>33</td><td>6.6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>100</td><td>1,502</td><td>15.0</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>80</td><td>1,206</td><td>15.1</td><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1992</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>84</td><td>1,201</td><td>14.3</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>58</td><td>6.4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1993</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>98</td><td>1,503</td><td>15.3</td><td>15</td><td>3</td><td>69</td><td>23.0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1994</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>112</td><td>1,499</td><td>13.4</td><td>13</td><td>7</td><td>93</td><td>13.3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>122</td><td>1,848</td><td>15.1</td><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>36</td><td>7.2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>108</td><td>1,254</td><td>11.6</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>77</td><td>7.0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>78</td><td>11.1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-10</td><td>-10.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>82</td><td>1,157</td><td>14.1</td><td>9</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>67</td><td>830</td><td>12.4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>13</td><td>6.5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>San Francisco 49ers</td><td>16</td><td>75</td><td>805</td><td>10.7</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>-2</td><td>-2.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>Oakland Raiders</td><td>16</td><td>83</td><td>1,139</td><td>13.7</td><td>9</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>Oakland Raiders</td><td>16</td><td>92</td><td>1,211</td><td>13.2</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>20</td><td>6.7.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>Oakland Raiders</td><td>16</td><td>63</td><td>869</td><td>13.8</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>Oakland/Seattle</td><td>17</td><td>30</td><td>429</td><td>14.3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2>Career Total</td><td>303</td><td>1,549</td><td>22,895</td><td>14.8</td><td>197</td><td>87</td><td>645</td><td>7.4</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Jerry Rice Net Worth | Houses, Cars, & Lifestyle</h2><p>To begin with, the retired NFL star owned a luxurious <strong>$9 million</strong> mansion. It isn’t just any fancy-looking house; it’s a smart house. You heard it correctly. Not a single penny got used on useless purchases.</p><p>To illustrate, the house had six bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a movie theatre, a pool house, and a gift-wrapping room.</p><p>It sounds strange, but it is cool at the same. Jerry Rice’s net worth would be meaningless without a bit of spending, right?</p><p>In addition, the custom-made house gives the owner full autonomy over the house. Whether the owner is a few miles away or across seven seas, the satellite system built in the house is accessible from anywhere on Earth.</p><p>Moving on, the pool house sits in a large area, which gives the vibe of some luxurious hotel pool but just with some special modesty to it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jerry-580.jpg><p>Likewise, the large acre of land houses a deck where family or guests can sit back and enjoy themselves in front of a green yard.</p><p>A separate dining table is present in cases of the arrival of many guests. Further, the gift-wrapping room is technically a state-of-art commodity stocked with various wrapping papers.</p><h3>Other Area Of Smart House</h3><p>Most importantly, the kitchen is what attracts more attention. Some striking designs include a few overhanging lamps, a large counter, a beautifully ornated wall, a double wall oven, and a neatly lined cabinet to place cutleries.</p><p>We can talk about the great space all day, but we would like to add more. There is a private home office, a theatre room that seats almost 9-12 people, a cozy breakfast nook, and a gym room.</p><p>In 2007, Jerry listed it for <strong>$22 million</strong> but, as of late, sold it for <strong>$9 million</strong>. Buyers will be lucky to have this accommodation for such a reasonable price. Above all, the compound comes with a large backyard.</p><p>At present, Rice owns a mansion in Atherton, California. In particular, the exquisite residence took exactly a year to design and three years to build. The house has designer furniture, a gym room, a theatre, and a pool.</p><p>Jerry lives with her wife, Latisha Pelayo, whom he has dated since 2008. The couple got &nbsp;married on October 21, 2019,</p><h3>Car</h3><p>Now, let’s move to his car collections. The NFL receiver owns a yellow Lamborghini Diablo, which cost him about <strong>$690 k</strong>.
