He then closes up the Happy Meal box, while leaving the camera recording to see his son's reaction, gauging whether or not he will notice he's been McDuped.</p><p>The young boy's father gets sat in front of the camera and his dad tells him that he got him a Happy Meal, which brings a smile to the child's face.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mamfam4</span></figure><p>At first, he extricates a french fry from the box and smells it before taking a bite....he seems to immediately sense something is wrong as he continues to chomp on the potato, and then adds salt to improve the flavor. "There we go," he says.</p><p>He opens up his container of chicken nuggets, and it only takes him a glance to see that they appear different than the ones he's probably accustomed to from the fast food franchise.</p><p>"I think he notices," the dad writes in a text overlay, followed up a laughing emoji. "Y'all tweakin'," the young boy says into the camera while holding up the nugget.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mamfam4</span></figure><p>He takes a bite, still looking into the camera, with a suspecting look on his face. "What's going on?" he asks, after remarking that the nuggets "taste weird."</p><p>"I'm done with this," he says, placing his food back into the Happy Meal box. He then extricates the toy from the box, which is a pair of fake teeth: something you'd see in a gag store or a Party City.</p><p>"What the f---," the young man says while looking into the camera, the faux teeth in his mouth.</p><p>Commenters seemed tickled pink by the young man's reaction to the disappointment he felt with the Happy Meal: "He said this happy meal is not happy mealing," one wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mamfam4</span></figure><p>Another thought that it funny that he was seemingly conducting an entire review in the video: "Not him doing a food review lol"</p><p>"the toy and what he said after had me Rollin," someone else penned.</p><p>If you've got a Happy Meal-loving kid, do you think that they would also notice if you swapped out the offerings on them?
