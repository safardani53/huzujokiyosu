Playing in that league has always been a big dream, having had a taste at Arsenal.</p><p>“But to be able to go in there as a mature player with more experience would be amazing.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE FOOTBALL NEWS">READ MORE FOOTBALL NEWS</h2><p>“It was incredible coming through at Arsenal. It taught me so much —&nbsp;all my technical and physical abilities are from Arsenal.</p><p>“I was so lucky because I was in the first-team from the age of 17 so had to turn into a man quite early and I then went into my first loan when I was 18. Things happened quickly for me but I’m grateful for everything they did for me.”</p><p><a href=#>Akpom is a lifelong Arsenal fan</a> and even played alongside current boss Mikel Arteta.</p><p>And he said: “Mikel was such a leader. He didn’t need to shout on the pitch, it was off the field where he really led. He was always making sure everyone was doing things properly.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="BETTING SPECIAL - BEST FOOTBALL BETTING SITES IN THE UK (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">BETTING SPECIAL - BEST FOOTBALL BETTING SITES IN THE UK</a></strong></p><p>“It’s no surprise to see him so successful as a manager because you could see he had those qualities as a player. Because I’m an Arsenal fan, it makes it even better.”</p><p>One manager who is also flying right now is Carrick.</p><p>Since the former Manchester United and England international took over after Chris Wilder was sacked, Boro have been racing up the Championship.</p><p>After losing his first game in charge at Preston in October, the team were fourth bottom. But a run of eight wins and a draw from the next nine league games have seen them shoot to fourth top going into tomorrow’s trip to the Stadium of Light.</p><p>And <a href=#>Akpom</a> said: “The best thing about it is having a manager you can relate to. He was a professional player at the highest level and was successful in what he did.&nbsp;</p><p>“He knows how the players feel and how they deal with things. He knows the best way to communicate and get the best out of us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GETTY_Arsenal-Training-Session_SPO_GYI1000144458jpg-JS420906730-1-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/4dc605b4-4b25-46d0-a438-aa1fb0c20f1f-1.jpg><p>“The new manager has completely changed things around. He immediately brought in that calmness – everyone talks about it. And it’s not just his calmness, he’s also very determined. You can see why he had such a successful career.</p><p>“We’ve set a standard now with our performances and whenever we go a bit below that the gaffer is on to us.</p><p>“For example we beat Blackburn 2-1 away and we’d always happily take three points at Ewood Park.</p><p>“But when we got into the changing room, the gaffer was frustrated at how we dealt with the game because they were reduced to 10 men.</p><p>“We got the three points, a difficult place, but the gaffer was not happy. That shows how high his standards are and how ambitious he is.”</p><p>It was incredible coming through at Arsenal. It taught me so much —&nbsp;all my technical and physical abilities are from Arsenal.</p><span class=quote-credit>Chuba Akpom</span><p>And Akpom has no doubt Carrick will emerge as a top boss just like Arteta did.</p><p>The forward added: “Definitely, he’ll become a top manager — especially working with young players. They are the future. He is the perfect person for that. He is always positive. When something bad happens, he isn’t dwelling on that.</p><p>“Even when something good happens he doesn’t dwell on that either.</p><p>“He is always thinking how can we get better, how can we improve as a team and individually? I think and hope he’ll have a successful managerial career in the future.”</p><p>One of the most satisfying moments Akpom enjoyed this season was his Boxing Day hat-trick in a 4-1 win against Wigan. It helped him win the SkyBet Championship player-of-the-month award for December.</p><p>It was only his second career hat-trick —&nbsp;and came almost seven years after his previous one in January 2016 for Hull in the FA Cup against Bury.</p><p>And he has revealed how the matchball was immediately commandeered by his two-year-old son Azai.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/msemail_Chuba_Akpomjpg-JS788053318-1.jpg><p>He said: “I cannot believe it’s been so long since I last got one. But to score it on Boxing Day in front of a full stadium was perfect.</p><p>“My son was kicking it around as soon as I got back home. I wanted to nicely frame it but he has already got dirt all over it!”</p><p>With all the interest from Prem clubs, Boro have sensibly taken out their one-year option to extend his contract beyond this season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Akpom said: “I’m happy at the club and cannot complain. Everyone is positive with me and friendly. There are good vibes going round the whole club.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve got my feet on the ground and trying to work hard to continue the form I am in so it’s all smiles from me!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9yfZBqaXJqX5i1tq7AZpikqJ%2BieqK%2B0p6lmqRdoralsMueqpuqn6q0qXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erika-jayne-claims-tom-girardi-confronted-robber-during-burglary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erika Jayne Claims Tom Girardi Confronted Robber During Burglary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zahara-jolie-pitt-birthday-best-photos-3464503.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best Pics Of Angie &amp;amp; Brads Oldest Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
