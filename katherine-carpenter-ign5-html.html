Kate Carpenter was the wife of Nicholas Carpenter, who built a cabin at the site of White Sulphur Springs in about 1750 and was granted 950 acres there in 1755. In 1756 they were enumerated "In ye lower end of Augusta County" VA. In September 1756, Indians raided the settlements on the Virginia frontier in what was at the time in Augusta County, Virginia. Legends vary, but generally agree that Nicholas and Kate had a very young daughter, Frances Carpenter, who was too young to travel fast enough to escape the attackers, so Kate took her up on the highest mountain near their cabin in hopes of finding refuge while Nicholas went for help from the forts on Jacksons River in present-day Allegheny County, Virginia. He reached Dinwiddie's Fort, but was killed in its defense.</p><table class=wikibox readability=1><tr><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>ca. 1730s</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>1784</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Nationality</td><td class=wk_value>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Known for</td><td class=wk_value>Namesake for Kate's Mountain</td></tr></table><p>Family Member katherine carpenter was born on November 30, 1944 in Hollywood, California, United States (She's 79 years old now).</p><p>Former actress and model best known as the wife of&nbsp;<a class=tzp_t href=# title="NCIS TV-Show">TV-Show NCIS</a>&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# title="David McCallum wikipedia">TV Actor David McCallum</a>.</p><p>All information about katherine carpenter can be found in this post.
