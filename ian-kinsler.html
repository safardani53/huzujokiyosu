But he declined it both times, thinking he was not ready for the MLB. Instead, he played college baseball with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Arizona College</a>.</p><p>After that, he headed to the University of Missouri Tigers on the special request of Tigers coach <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Jamieson</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tablet-mag-images.b-cdn.net/production/72013d5ca6b48188dfc126f66579502f3dbd767e-620x416.jpg><p>In the 2003 MLB Draft, Kinsler was picked up by Texas Rangers in the 17th round (overall: 496th).</p><h3>Texas Rangers</h3><h4>Minor Leagues</h4><p>On his twenty-first birthday, Kinsler signed a<strong> $30,000</strong> contract with Texas Rangers. He played for Spokane Indians in the 2003 season. Also, he worked with Rangers’ physical coaches to improve his physical abilities.</p><p>Kinsler began the 2004 season with Low-A Clinton LumberKings but got his promotion in mid-season to Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. He completed the winter season playing for Arizona Fall League club Peoria Saguaros.</p><p>Likewise, he played for Triple-A club Oklahoma RedHawks for the 2005 season. Due to Alfonso Soriano’s absence, he changed his position to the <a href=#>second baseman</a> from shortstop.</p><h4>MLB</h4><p>Due to Soriano’s absence, Kinsler quickly sealed his starting position at the second base in 2006. On opening day, he played his first-ever MLB game against Boston Red Sox on April 3, 2006.</p><p>In August 2007, he made eight plate appearances in a nine innings game to tie an MLB record. Further, he was one of the six batters in the American League to obtain 20+ stolen bases and 20+ home runs.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “I’m trying to put good swings on the ball, and if it goes out, it goes out.”</p><p>However, on August 17, 2008, Ian injured the left side of his groin on a defensive play and suffered from a sports hernia that ultimately required season-ending surgery. Sadly, he missed the last 37 games of that season due to that injury.</p><p>Despite missing the last six weeks of the season, he led the stolen bases chart for Rangers that season. Later, Kinsler extended his contract for five years for <strong>$22 Million</strong> in 2008.</p><p>Moreover, he was an AL All-Star 2008 at the 79th All-Star held at Yankees Stadium. Though, he lost to Dustin Pedroia by almost 34 thousand votes in fan balloting.</p><p>Read about Ian Kinsler former Red Sox teammate: <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Brock Holt Bio: Age, Career, Wife, Net Worth, Instagram Wiki>></a></strong></p><p>After his excellent performance in 2009, he joined the 30-30 club. Also, he hit for the cycle on April 15, 2009, to become the fourth Rangers player.</p><p>Kinsler finished the 2010 season with the fifth-highest fielding base percentage (.985) in the league. Moreover, he also got honored by AL All-Star for the second time in his career.</p><p>In 2011, he hit lead-off home runs in the first two games to become the first in MLB history to do so. He joined the 30-30 club for a record second time, becoming the 12th player ever to complete that.</p><p>In the 2012 season, he got named in the Al All-Star for the third time. A year later, he became the stolen base leader of all time for Texas Rangers.</p><h3>Detroit Tigers</h3><p>On a blockbuster deal, Rangers and Tigers swapped two All-Stars, Ian Kinsler and Prince Fielder, in 2013. He got the honor to wear the famous <strong>#3</strong> at Detroit Tigers.</p><p>Due to his excellent performance, he got named to the All-Star team for the fourth time. The same season, he was also honored with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilson Defensive Player of the Year</a>.</p><p>In his second year in Detroit, he won the Fielding Bible Award. At the end of the 2016 season, he won the Gold Glove Award for the second base position. Though, he seemed a little slower in 2017.</p><h3>Los Angles Angels</h3><p>In December 2017, Ian was traded to LA Angels in return for Troy Montgomery and Wilkel Hernandez. Despite his good performances, he was traded to Boston Red Sox in July 2018.</p><h3>Boston Red Sox</h3><p>After his first season with Red Sox, Ian won his second career gold glove for second base. After all the wait, Kinsler got his first World Series ring against LA Dodgers in the World Series 2018.</p><h3>San Diego Padres</h3><p>Kinsler’s season finished early as he underwent a herniated Disc on his neck.
