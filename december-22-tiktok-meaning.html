On that date in 2022, a rare incident occured.</h2><p>If you go on TikTok often, you may have heard some folks reference the December 22 incident but weren't sure what they were talking about. Creator Noah Glenn Carter (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@noahglenncarter</a>) explains in a video why this date is known “as the most infamous day in TikTok history.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“On that day, many TikTok users found out they could post corn if they posted the corn using TikTok’s slideshow effect," he said. (Note: Corn is code for sexually explicit content).</p><p>“The corn went mega, mega, viral," he continued. "For some reason, TikTok’s algorithm started recommending it to everyone on the app, and videos that were just straight corn were getting millions upon millions of views and many of them weren’t even getting taken down."</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Know Your Meme</a>, this graphic content continued to circulate on the platform for a few days. By Dec. 25, 2022, it seemingly had been all cleaned up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>According to Noah, there is no official explanation as to how this incident happened. But he has a theory as to why things got so out of hand on that date specifically.</p><p>"You see this incident happened right before Christmas," he explained in the same video. "And because of this, I believe many of the people in charge of moderation at TikTok had been given Christmas off so they weren’t at the office to stop this when it did happen."</p><p>Noah also noted that TikTok never fully terminated this explicit content issue as similar incidents to this, on a much smaller scale, have continued to occur. For example, many filters such as <a href=#>the now-removed Pokémon 777</a> would show users corn when used.</p><p>Furthermore, Noah believes inappropriate content will continue to make its way onto the platform, much to TikTok's chagrin. “Just remember that December 22 is where it all began," he says at the end of his video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKkscybnKtlYmd6tbXKraakZZ2arq%2B1zaA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-robinson-3.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Robinson (rugby union)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./summer-walker-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of The Singer Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
