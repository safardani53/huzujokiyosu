Thank you, Jesus, for saving our niece who was in the car with her.”</p><p>The “Girl, I Slept in My Makeup” podcast hosts added, “To know our mom was to love her. She was a shining light to all who were lucky enough to know her. She loved so fiercely. She felt so deeply. And she loved Jesus with all her heart. Her world was FAMILY. She loved her 4 children and many grand babies to the depths of her soul, and she left us doing what she loved most- caring for her grand babies. We are in shock and are experiencing an indescribable pain.”</p><p>Brandi and her husband,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>Bryan Redmond</strong></a>, share<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> daughters Brooklyn, 11, </a>Brinkley and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">son Bruin, 2.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RHOD-Brandi-Redmond-Reveals-Mother-in-Law-Jill-Marie-Redmond-Died-in-Car-Crash-Feature.jpg><p>One week earlier, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Bravo star</a> celebrated Brinkley’s 9th birthday with a sweet tribute via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram.</a></p><p>“Happy 9th Birthday @brinkley__redmond,” Brandi captioned a photo of her daughter on Sunday, October 4. “You are my sunshine.
