Like I’m hiding from the Nazis. Sex with me is like arriving late at the theatre and trying to find your seat.</p><p>“Some shuffling, a bit of shushing, a pause and then from somewhere in the darkness just a whispered, ‘Sorry’. And never an applause.”</p><p>Whitehall has been very coy about the secret to his success in the past - even previously joking: "I’ve never laughed a woman into bed, but I’ve laughed one out of bed many times."</p><p>Nonetheless, it's clear he knows exactly how to charm a stunning celeb - here are the stars he's charmed over the years...<br></p><h2>Gemma Chan</h2><p>Whitehall's longest relationship was with Humans star Gemma Chan, who he dated for six years before their shock split in December 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000212439771-e1586344790743.jpg><p>The pair met in 2011 when they both starred in E4 comedy Fresh Meat, with Chan eventually moving in with the comedian in his Notting Hill flat.</p><p>However, they eventually parted ways after struggling to make their relationship work around their hectic filming schedules.</p><p>A source told The Sun at the time: “Jack and Gemma secretly pulled the plug on their relationship but remain good friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000428451589.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000029789786-e1586344906153.jpg><p>“For the past couple of years they’ve both been finding it difficult to make proper time for one another and, with their schedules showing no signs of slowing down, have decided to go their separate ways.</p><p>“It’s sad but they remain supportive of one another.”<br></p><h2>Kate Beckinsale</h2><p>Around a year after his split from Chan, in November 2018, Whitehall set tongues wagging when he was pictured sharing a steamy kiss with actress Kate Beckinsale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000446568788-e1586345138197.jpg><p>The pair appeared to enjoy a night out together in LA, before they were spotted heading to a hotel together in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>They had enjoyed a meal at the restaurant Craig’s, a popular celeb hangout in Hollywood, before leaving separately in a bid to avoid being spotted, <a href=#>we revealed at the time.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000543882923.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000565111113-e1586346491238.jpg><p>Whitehall was later picked up by the Pearl Harbour actress in her SUV before they headed to the Blind Dragon karaoke lounge, where he pulled her in for a passionate embrace.</p><p>The short-lived romance didn't appear to go any further than the one night out, however.</p><h2>Kirsty Gallacher</h2><p>While Whitehall has known Kirsty Gallacher for years, having appeared on A League of Their Own together, <a href=#>they were first romantically linked in April 2018</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000575880139-e1586347105791.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000445669388.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000442950397-e1586345438257.jpg><p>The pair were spotted flirting together at a party before heading into a room alone after a steamy clinch in front of fellow celeb guests.</p><p>The Sun revealed at the time how he later told pals <a href=#>Freddie Flintoff</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Jamie Redknapp</a> of his romp with the Sky Sports host.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000512278430.jpg><p>A source said chemistry was "brewing between them all night" at the time and added: “They were kissing and being very touchy-feely before heading off for some privacy. Everybody there knew what was going on."</p><p>Both declined to comment at the time, and the romance never took off from there.<br></p><h2>Paris Hilton</h2><p>More recently, Whitehall <a href=#>sparked rumours there could be sparks flying with none other than US socialite Paris Hilton</a>.</p><p>The comedian was invited along to Hilton's star-studded birthday bash in March last year, while the pair also raised eyebrows with their apparent ‘flirting’ on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000575863132-e1586345608237.jpg><p>Sources close to Paris told Sun Online how she thought Whitehall was “hot” and subsequently invited him to the party. Whitehall spent time in her swimming pool splashing around on an inflatable unicorn as they partied at her spectacular Beverly Hills mansion.</p><p>It appears Jack first caught the multi-millionaire's eye when he <a href=#>presented the Brit Awards in February that year</a>.</p><p>Hilton followed him on social media and fans immediately spotted them sharing the odd comment and like on each other's photos.</p><p>Sadly, nothing ever came of the rumours - at least in public - after the party.</p><h2>Dua Lipa</h2><p>It seems Whitehall's Brits exploits didn't only catch Hilton's eye - as he was also <a href=#>linked to Dua Lipa following his time on stage the year before, in 2018.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000387331562-e1586345745511.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000387290355-e1586345793147.jpg><p>The funnyman was spotted cuddling up and dirty dancing with the New Rules singer during the show’s after-party, sparking talk of a possible romance.</p><p>According to close pals, Jack made a beeline to Dua because he thinks she’s “incredibly hot".</p><p>A friend said at the time: “Dua is definitely Jack’s type and he’s always mega fancied her.</p><p>“They met years ago and often bump into each other because of work&nbsp;– but Jack would love to spend more time with her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000551833487.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574421798-1.jpg><p>“He had to catch a flight early yesterday morning so couldn’t stay at the party as long as he would have liked, though hopes Dua will be in touch.”</p><p>It's unclear if she ever did, however, and the short attraction appears to have ended there.</p><h2>Brooklyn Beckham's ex Hana Cross</h2><p>The Brits once again proved a winner for Whitehall this year, <a href=#>as he was spotted chatting closely with Brooklyn Beckham’s ex-girlfriend Hana Cross</a> at the Warner x Ciroc party at central London’s Chiltern Firehouse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000564259922-e1586345871912.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000514874308-e1586345910718.jpg><p>He was later seen leaving with model Hana, 21, and some friends in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>The photos incidentally emerged shortly after we revealed he was <a href=#>on celebrity dating app Raya</a>, which Cross was also been using to find a man.</p><p>An onlooker said: “Jack was stood chatting to Hana at the bar for some time and they looked really into each other.</p><p>“They had some other friends with them but Jack and Hana kept getting drawn back together."</p><p>Nothing ever came of it, however.</p><h2>Portuguese model Alexandra Schutz</h2><p>More recently, Whitehall was linked to Portuguese model Alexandra Schutz, who he met in November last year, as <a href=#>she's thought to have&nbsp;joined him on his comedy stand-up tour - where they grew close</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000572160948-e1586345983743.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000572162187-e1586346033712.jpg><p>A source said: “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack</a> was besotted with her — and you can’t blame him, she’s beautiful."</p><p>Alexandra works as a director of marketing and communication for Spanish e-sports firm Esportia.</p><p>The bond between them didn't develop, though, as Whitehall has since found love with Horner.</p><h2>Lottie Moss</h2><p>Whitehall has certainly been linked to some stunning models in the past, and <a href=#>he was even spotted getting close with blonde fashionista Lottie Moss</a> at Glastonbury’s secret party zone The Rabbit Hole last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000501928098-e1586346104485.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000501698698-e1586346148835.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000507704371.jpg><p>Whitehall and Moss, the younger half-sister of model Kate Moss, were canoodling in the tent and dancing with their arms around each other.</p><p>They left together after 2am while flirting playfully on the way home before going to the same campsite accommodation.</p><p>A source close to Jack said simply: “Jack and Lottie are good mates. They have a lot of mutual friends.”<br></p><h2>Melinda London</h2><p>Whitehall was spotted <a href=#>stepping out with German lingerie model Melinda London, who’s ten years his junior, in May last year</a>&nbsp;after she split with DJ and producer Jonas Blue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000490428825.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000490428827.jpg><p>The couple were seen together having dinner at an exclusive&nbsp;<a href=#>private members club</a>&nbsp;in West&nbsp;<a href=#>London.</a></p><p>Among her many assignments the model, whose nickname is Sharky, has previously posed for a racey photoshoot for&nbsp;<a href=#>Playboy</a> magazine.</p><p>Again, it appears they didn't go the long-haul - or even, in fact, beyond an initial date or two.</p><h2>Roxie Nafousi</h2><p>Although little is known of Whitehall's romantic life before his relationship with Chan, he's rumoured to have enjoyed a romance with Instagram star and blogger Roxie Nafousi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000575860800.jpg><p>According to Hello! magazine, she previously congratulated Jack on a BAFTA win via Twitter.</p><p>The pair have been pictured at events over the years, seemingly sharing a close friendship ever since.</p><p>While he's certainly enjoyed a stellar dating life over the last couple of years, here's hoping he's found love with Horner.
