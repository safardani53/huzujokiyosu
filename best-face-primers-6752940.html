It’s a face primer. Face primers are a surefire way to not only smooth the texture and tone of your skin, but lock your makeup in for an all-day stay that will keep your foundation, concealer, powder, and more right where you applied it that morning. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Red carpet regulars like Selena Gomez</a> accredit their effortlessly smooth and glassy skin — even under the camera flashes — to the skillful use of a primer that perfects those pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I personally think of primer as an extension of your skin care routine that can, in some cases, aid with your makeup application or desired final look,” says Katie Mellinger, celebrity makeup artist to the likes of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emma Watson</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Stephanie Beatriz</a>.&nbsp;This step in the process bridges the gap between skincare and makeup, sealing in the nourishment from your serums and moisturizers and prepping your skin for a flawless canvas that will hold your makeup in place throughout the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers put 31 popular face primers through a series of challenges to discover which products erased their pores and kept their makeup in place.

The Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer is the summation of all of these, which is why it’s our best overall pick. The clear, gel-like liquid primer hydrates and smooths your skin while leaving you with a radiant glow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers reported that their skin looked and felt beyond smooth and maintained, with “just the right balance of moisture.” They also loved how effortlessly the foundation blended on top of the tester’s primed skin, leaving their complexions nothing short of “flawless.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This primer’s plant and mineral-based formula includes blue agave extract for makeup preservation, hyaluronic acid and hemp-derived cannabis seed extract for a smoothing effect, and niacinamide and aloe water to further moisturize the skin. While this cooling gel formula may be a treat to some, this type of primer may not be the ideal consistency for every user. But for our tester, it was perfect. “I don't have anything negative to say other than it’s amazing,” she raved. “I will be using this product everyday.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Scoring a perfect five stars across every category of our testing — from application to feel to look — this primer seriously deserves a space in your makeup collection (right next to your coveted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eyeshadow palette</a>, of course).

The e.l.f. Cosmetics Poreless Putty Primer is the perfect example of this. It retails at under $10, yet it ranked high in performance across all of our tests. This primer scored a perfect five stars for the way the product feels and looks on the skin. Our testers celebrated how it melts into and soothes the skin, a byproduct of the formula’s infusion of squalane — a natural ingredient that is not only moisturizing, but locks in preexisting hydration, as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester raved about how beautifully this putty blends into the skin, stating that it “spreads like butter” despite its solid-looking form. They also pointed out that this primer worked marvelously well with silicone-based foundation, as it minimized the appearance of pores and provided a satin finish to their base makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only qualm our testers had with this primer was the lack of a tool to apply the putty with since it was difficult to extract from the tub without one (especially if you have long nails). “I would add an applicator to the product to be able to apply it more easily,” the tester shared. “Other than that, this product is wonderful!” For a drugstore price and high-quality results, we’d say that this primer is still an excellent value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.74 oz. | <strong>Finish: </strong>Satin | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>All | <strong>Base: </strong>Water</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-hourglass-veil-mineral-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4WnvqNzKHEalW4nFIqHuaKTdOlQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hourglass-veil-mineral-primer-434da369912c4528abf87543ebf5d0e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>A little goes a long way with this formula, so you can prolong the life of your expensive primer</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We saw a visible change in the evenness of our skin tones</p></li><li readability=0><p>This primer does double time as a SPF 15 broad-spectrum sunscreen, as well</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we’re gonna splurge on a beauty product, we want it to do what it says (and then some). And the Veil Mineral Primer from Hourglass delivers. With just a few small pumps of the product, this primer not only evens any redness in the skin, but it also minimizes the appearance of pores, wrinkles, and fine lines, and provides a solid base for foundation. Not only will your skin appear smoother than ever, but this primer also contains SPF 15 for a little extra sun protection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After using this primer, our testers admired how smoothly their foundation glided on their face, especially the skin around their mouths, which they identified as their “problem areas.” They scored the final look and application categories of the test with perfect five out of five stars, praising the way the primer complimented their makeup and sat on the skin. However, they wished there was a bit more of a hydrating aspect to this primer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After applying a small amount of the primer, the tester noted that their skin felt slightly dry underneath their makeup. For an extra jolt of hydration, we recommend using your favorite facial moisturizer as a solid base, then going in with the Hourglass primer once the lotion has settled in, and finishing it off with your favorite foundation and makeup products. However, people who experience oily skin or hot climates might find that this formula controls their sebum a bit more effectively than others — the perfect equilibrium for oily skin or hot days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.1 oz. | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>All | <strong>Base: </strong>Silicone</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pore-minimizing-tarte-cosmetics-poreless-mattifying-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Pore-Minimizing</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Cosmetics Poreless Mattifying Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tarte Cosmetics Poreless Mattifying Primer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/RiF9zkP60TfWn2B4Hd48GYP7iAY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tarte-cosmetics-poreless-mattifying-primer-9025edfab7204a0aba4ffb20feff5017.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>Thanks to its creamy formula, this primer was super easy to blend into our skin</p></li><li readability=0><p>For being a mattifying primer, this was both incredibly smoothing and hydrating on our skin</p></li><li readability=0><p>Its tried-and-true waterproof capabilities are great for preventing your makeup from sweating off on hot days</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perfect for a no-makeup makeup look or as a solid base for airbrushed-looking foundation, the Tarte Poreless Mattifying Primer is a product that will have you wondering where your pores went. This primer is specially formulated with optical matte-blur technology, which smooths out any textural imperfections and erases any unnecessary shine from overly oily spots on your face. In addition to this, this primer is also waterproof, so you won’t have to sweat (pun intended) the hot summer days where you’re in full glam. Simply swipe on, smooth out, and put your best face forward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester compared the consistency to that of clear Vaseline and felt that it “wasn't too oily and had the perfect amount of moisturization.” They noted the soft and smooth feel of the primer on their skin, complimenting not only how great this clear primer felt on their skin, but also how it made their makeup look when applied on top. “My makeup went on so smoothly. I absolutely can't see any pores,” they shared. “All the other testers kept complimenting my makeup after using the primer!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With over one fluid ounce of product, this primer is sure to last you a long time — but that amount and quality adds up to quite a charge. The $32 price tag may feel steep to some, but the pore-defeating and ultra-smoothing results are sure to justify the cost. “This primer is a gamechanger,” our tester concluded. “I'm going to include it in my makeup routine every day.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.01 oz | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>All | <strong>Base: </strong>Silicone</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-oily-skin-fenty-beauty-pro-filtr-mattifying-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Oily Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Mattifying Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Mattifying Primer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Ji8uQli2EY4jrHNyARTpHYV046A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fenty-beauty-pro-filtr-mattifying-primer-0ba13f12f8c742e19457e6c33b87fa31.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Despite being heavy-duty on oil control, this primer felt super lightweight</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The formula was effectively mattifying without stripping our skin of its natural hydration</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We noticed that our complexions appeared to be more evenly toned after using this primer</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your skin’s gradual production of oil throughout the day can lead to the separation of your makeup — especially if you have naturally oily skin. A way to control this is with a mattifying primer, and the one that our testers found to be the most effective for oily skin was the Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Mattifying Primer. This primer is specifically targeted for people with combination-to-oily skin, as the product will control the natural shine on your skin and prevent makeup from sliding around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers were particularly impressed by how lightweight this shine-controlling primer was, despite its mattifying formula. “Sometimes primers can feel really stiff, especially when they are mattifying, but this primer did not feel that way at all,” they shared.

This requires a different type of primer that will hold makeup in place all day. The Too Faced Hangover Primer is the product you’ll want to reach for if your skin falls in the normal to dry category, as the nourishing formula is pumped with coconut water and probiotics to boost the skin’s hydration and elasticity. These two ingredients are like a drink of water to thirsty skin, illuminating the barrier for a lit-from-within glow once foundation is applied.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tester trying out this product appreciated how easy it was to apply this liquid primer, needing only one pump of the product to cover the entirety of their face. Once worked into the skin, they were able to take in how comfortably the primer felt both before and after makeup application, sharing that it “doesn’t feel sticky or like glue… and [they] would definitely use this product as a lightweight moisturizer, too.” They also found favor with the pump applicator, which cuts down on the potential of wasting excess primer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there were next to no issues to be had with this primer, the tester shared their wishes that the primer contained SPF to any degree — though this can be remedied with the use of SPF-infused foundation. They also want to make potential shoppers aware of the coconut scent, as this kind of fragrance could be right up your alley or off-putting to some. Regardless of scent or SPF, this primer has all of the hydrating and staying power that you may not have known your makeup routine needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.35 oz. | <strong>Finish: </strong>Radiant | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>Normal, dry, combination | <strong>Base: </strong>Water</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-smoothing-nyx-professional-makeup-marshmellow-smoothing-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Smoothing</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYX Professional Makeup Marshmellow Smoothing Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NYX Professional Makeup Marshmellow Smoothing Primer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/kvcJ5k5mSGoXCRotvYM-tJDqv4o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/121-2b207b8f84be4c2b862901e86cb80058.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>As per the name, this airy primer did a great job at smoothing our complexions and pores</p></li><li readability=0><p>Infused with marshmallow root, its formula was incredibly hydrating</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Our skin looked and felt smoother after we applied this primer</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If smooth skin is what you’re after (let’s face it, who isn’t), then the Marshmellow Smoothing Primer from NYX could be your new secret to buttery skin. This whipped cream-like primer is dispensed out of a pump and is meant to be applied with a sponge, but it works just fine with your fingers, too. The product is described as a 10-in-1 primer, promising to smooth, moisturize, extend makeup longevity for up to 16 hours, hydrate, soothe, even the skin tone, minimize pre-existing texture, blur fine lines, provide a blurred finish, and keep your makeup looking freshly-applied all day long. And after earning a perfect score, with five out of five stars in every testing category, it’s safe to say that this primer was able to meet most of those claims.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester expressed their satisfaction with how nicely the product laid under their foundation, leaving no residue behind and smoothing over uneven skin texture and pores. “The primer alone evened out my skin tone and added moisture to my skin,” they later stated, approving of the primer on its own, too. The vegan formula is fortified with marshmallow root extract, a soothing agent that not only glosses over the skin for flawless makeup, but softens the skin over time, as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only thing our tester pointed out was that it took a touch longer than most to dry and felt sticky during this time, but eventually the formula settled in and took to subsequent foundation beautifully. So if you’re in a hurry, this product may add a little more time to your clock — but if you’re looking for a low-cost yet high-value primer that erases your imperfections, then this could be the perfect contender.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.01 oz. | <strong>Finish: </strong>Radiant | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>All | <strong>Base: </strong>Water</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-natural-ingredients-honest-beauty-everything-primer-matte></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Natural Ingredients</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Honest Beauty Everything Primer Matte</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Honest Beauty Everything Primer Matte" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/MXsle5g9BCvrw7TvnktUe3WaHjk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Honest-Beauty-Everything-Primer-Matte-521ce1ad75f546199eed970737e56417.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>This primer had some serious shine control abilities</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite being a mattifying primer, we were still able to achieve the look of natural-looking skin</p></li><li readability=1><p>We appreciated that the formula is free of parabens, silicones, and phthalates</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As the average consumer becomes more well-versed with the quality of their products, both in performance and ingredients, there is a heightened demand for cleaner beauty products.

Our tester said that the formula was very effective in controlling shine and smoothing their skin texture, but noted that the primer made their pores smaller, not totally erased. However, they appreciated this factor, because they liked to still look natural. If you’re a natural glam lover through and through (and we mean ingredients and finish), then you’ll love this pick from Honest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 oz. | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>All | <strong>Base: </strong>Water</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-14 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3307 data-sizes=750px alt="Honest Beauty Everything Primer Matte displayed in front of stone slabs" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/QDhBPnFcJikN8GacgNihw3DwGOE=/fit-in/1500x3307/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-honest-beauty-everything-primer-matte-jjuliao-3463-49bcbd2f5b7c499f83fdd09741defdf5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=5792 data-sizes=750px alt="Person looking in a mirror while testing Honest Beauty Everything Primer Matte" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0aYRdF7BFgjCkwHKReu1XLOJx-0=/fit-in/1500x5792/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/face-primer-test-honest-beauty-everything-matte-lalmeida-4002-fce64757c2d64749abce47ff6ec2d357.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Leticia Almeida</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-illuminating-youthforia-pregame-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Illuminating</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Youthforia Pregame Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Youthforia Pregame Primer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JCCbwRaW1mqdNoNrYuamnCw7Fdg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/123-6d353ec7c78e4ceaa68564aba59464dc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Credo Beauty</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=0><p>This pearlescent formula infused an extra bit of shine under our makeup (without making us look oily)</p></li><li readability=2><p>Its botanical formula worked overtime as a skincare step, too, adding an extra dose of hydration to our makeup-prepped skin</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its light-filtering and pollution-protecting technology served as a barrier on our skin</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Glowy skin is the name of the game when it comes to modern beauty, so if your skin needs an extra boost of luminosity, then you might as well start at the base — with the right primer. The Youthforia Pregame Primer is unique because it’s a multi-use product that can be used alone as skincare, or as an emollient makeup product. It can also be mixed with your concealer or foundation for a sheer finish and you can even sleep in it (yes, you heard us right, you can actually sleep in this… and wake up with your skin looking better than the night before).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The smoothing formula grips makeup in place for all-day wear while simultaneously locking in moisture and the nurturing benefits of the brand’s signature Skin Save and Blueshield complexes, which are made from natural ingredients that reduce redness, protect the skin from pollutants and control the production of sebum (or oil). You can even use this primer on the height of your cheekbones or swipe it along your collarbones — truly anywhere you want to add a bit of radiance. Our tester fell for the luminous glow that this primer provided, stating that this hydrating product will come in handy during the cooler months, as moisturization and a nice glow is all they’ll need for their base.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One aspect to note is the scent, which our tester labeled as reminiscent of oatmeal, which could be a deciding factor for some interested customers.

Smooth as butter and full of hydration, this formula applies like a moisturizer and gives the skin a solid glow to build upon with foundation and concealer. “The primer made my skin feel plump and hydrated both visually and to the touch,” our tester remarked. “I also love that this has high SPF content, and could not sense any heavy active ingredients.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The benefit-packed formula includes an urban pollution defense complex plus UVA and UVB sun filters to protect your skin and is supplemented with collagen, hyaluronic acid, and peptides to further boost the skin’s overall health. Your skin will experience a bit of plumping from the airbrush polymers that are infused into the formula, which is a welcome side effect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this is most definitely a go-to product for many beauty lovers, this may feel like a bit of an investment for a small(er) amount of product to some consumers.

The type of finish your primer can provide will set the look for your glam — giving you a healthy glow or tactfully controlling shine in naturally oily areas, like the T-zone. The primer you’re eyeing will often advertise which type of finish it will give you, so it’s important to double check the primer of your choice beforehand to make sure you’re buying a glowy (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>think Meghan Markle</a>), mattifying (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>like Mindy Kaling</a>) or pore-minimizing formula (or a combination of these three). And, then match it with a suitable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>setting spray</a>, if you're using one.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><br>Skin Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your skin is an important factor to consider as you look for primer that works best for you, as some are specifically made for different textures and types, like oily, combination, or dry. Oftentimes primers will be infused with skincare elements, like hydration-boosting agents, natural ingredients that promote skin barrier nourishment, and more — making this a great option for those with dry skin. There also are primers that are specifically made for those with oily skin, usually providing a matte finish and an extra boost when it comes to oil control. Typically, most primers can be used on all skin types, but if you have normal to dry skin, a radiant-finish primer could be your best friend, and if you err on the side of oily skin, you could try out a matte primer to spot-treat slick areas before applying makeup. Those with oily skin can apply a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>quality toner</a> or another <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>oil-absorbing product</a> as part of their skincare routine, before primer application.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Silicone vs. Water-based&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from using quality ingredients, it’s important to make sure that the base of your primer aligns with the base of your face makeup, as well. “If the foundation you use has silicone in it, then it's usually best to use a primer with silicone in it, as well,” says Mellinger. “You want to avoid using a water-based foundation with a silicone primer as the silicone can cause the foundation to separate.” She adds that it’s also a good idea to pair water-based primers with water-based foundations, so it’s worth the extra minute it takes to check your foundation’s ingredients before adding a compatible primer to your cart. This will ensure that the product will not only grip your makeup in place, but put your best skin forward, as well.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As with most things, price is typically a factor that is top of mind for many shoppers. You can find quality primers within any budget (or lack thereof), it just depends where you look. For example, one of our favorites (and the winner of “best budget”) is the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">e.l.f. Cosmetics Poreless Putty Primer</a>. This is a crowd favorite that comes in at just under $10 and exemplifies that sometimes a product with a low price tag can outperform some of the more costly options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the other hand, if you want to invest a little more in a high-end primer that you know will deliver stunning results, then the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer</a>, which can go for up to $75, could be your perfect primer.

They all applied the same moisturizer supplied by our lab and chose a primer that had a similar base to their personal foundation that they brought in themselves, meaning they matched a silicone-based primer to a silicone-based foundation and vice versa for water-based products. The testers then dispensed a pea-sized amount of the primer onto their fingertips and worked it into their skin, starting at the center of the face and moving outwards. They allowed the primer to dry for a couple of minutes, evaluated how it felt on their skin, and applied their foundation as they normally would. After all of this was said and done, they evaluated the final product (i.e., their complete look) and recorded their insights based on application, feel, and look — rating each category from one to five (five being the best).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-75e5c30a-0b72-45ba-acc0-4bceec8e5597></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48.854424040067><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Why do you need a face primer?</span></p><p>Face primer will do several things for your makeup — control shine, keep your foundation in place all day, and nurture the skin in the process. “[Face] primer is there to help with the final effect of the makeup on the skin, so the type of primer is all relative to whatever issue you might have,” says Mellinger.</p><p>In short, the primer you choose will either mattify the high-shine areas of your face (like the T-zone, if you have oily skin) or add a bit of radiance if you have dry skin and want to hydrate your skin while simultaneously prolonging your makeup. Primers are also great for evening skin texture and minimizing the appearance of pores, which helps create a smoother canvas for your foundation application.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.97493285586392><p><span class=accordion__title>What ingredients should I look for in a primer?</span></p><p>After you identify which type of skin you have, you can move forward with the quest for quality ingredients. “If you need extra hydration, look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, algae extract, niacinamide,” shares Kristee Liu, makeup artist to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Brenda Song</a>. “If you need help to control excess oil, look for ingredients like salicylic acid, witch hazel, tea tree oil.” But since everyone’s skin can take differently to every ingredient, it’s important to do a patch test on a small area of the skin first.</p><p>Alternatively, there are definitely certain ingredients to steer clear of in your search, as well. Liu recommends staying far away from the products that include parabens, paraffin, phthalates, synthetic fragrance, and formaldehyde, to start. One of the most natural ingredient-packed products on this list is, you guessed it, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Everything Primer</a> from Honest Beauty, which is specifically formulated without these harmful ingredients — a great place to start if you want your base to be both product-staying and nourishing to the skin.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you apply face primer?</span></p><p>“Primer should be the last step of the skincare routine, right before your makeup application,” Liu advises. “Use a foundation brush or a wet makeup sponge to apply. Make sure the primer has time to set (about a minute or two) before applying makeup over it.” The artist reminds us to only use a small amount (and only on the few areas that you need it — you don’t need to apply it like a moisturizer), because a little goes a long way.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.84735202492212><p><span class=accordion__title>Should I buy primer with SPF?</span></p><p>SPF should be included wherever possible in your makeup routine in order to protect the skin barrier from cancer-causing UV rays, so starting at the base with your primer is a great place to squeeze in some sun protection if you can. While it’s fully acceptable to use an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>SPF-infused moisturizer</a> first and a regular primer second, you can knock both out in one go with an SPF-rich primer like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Charlotte Tilbury Invisible UV Flawless Primer</a>, which is fortified with SPF 50, or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer</a>, with a lower dosage of SPF 15. To make a long story short, if you can grab one with SPF, do it.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><br><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alyssa Brascia</a> is a commerce writer at PEOPLE, covering beauty, fashion, home and lifestyle products.
