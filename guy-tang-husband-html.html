So much so he was once&nbsp;in a relationship with a woman.</p><h2>Guy Tang's Coming Out as Gay Story</h2><p>Tang was in a long-term relationship with a girl. He even proposed to his girlfriend and eventually got engaged. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But instead of experiencing bliss with his future wife, Tang faced a double identity crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue emerged initially because of his Asian race. He had to face racism and felt like an outsider. The other source of the problem was he had still not come to terms with his sexuality and identified as gay.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Beauty Launchpad</a> in 2020, the&nbsp;hairstylist admitted he knew he was different deep down, but the fear of judgment was a barrier from accepting his gayness. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At the age of 27, a particular chain of events ultimately made him realize his stand; however, admitting he was gay wasn’t easy for him.&nbsp;</p><p>Mostly because coming out as gay was considered a sin in his hometown. Also, he had never seen anyone from his ethnicity doing so.</p><p>"I couldn’t just open up my phone and see, ‘Oh, there’s someone who looks like me,’” he remarked.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He reiterated that coming out of the closet, accepting himself as a gay person, was indeed hard for him.</p><p>When I came out, the hardest thing was to look at myself in the mirror, embrace myself and be true to myself.</p><p>During that time, Tang had already been engaged to his girlfriend, and he loved her dearly.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook video</a>, he shared how tough it was coming out to his then-fiancée.&nbsp;He also mentioned that he still missed his girlfriend, as she was his best friend too. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Thankfully, while he was getting over the separation, he met his future husband, Guevarra.&nbsp;</p><h2>Guy Tang's Husband Almar Guevarra Is&nbsp;Super Supportive</h2><p>Tang is often seen gushing about his supportive and wonderful spouse on social media.</p><p>On the romantic front, Guevarra has been making Tang’s life beautiful and comfortable for 11 years now.</p><p><img alt="Guy Tang and his husband Almar Guevarra." height=802 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/guy-tang-husband.jpg width=650 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Guy Tang with his husband Almar Guevarra in October 2021. </strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Almar Guevarra/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Currently, Tang’s partner is&nbsp;a brain cancer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">research nurse</a> fighting to make the world a more comfortable place for people living with brain cancer.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The hairstylist said that regardless of his spouse's medical background and finesse, Guevarra knows a thing or two about hair, which is Tang’s specialty.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He considers his spouse as the best partner in the world for his selfless love and support.&nbsp;</p><p>My husband is the best man ever because he is so supportive and loving.
