Over the years, fans have seen the boys from the Jonas Brothers become husbands and even fathers! Nick and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Priyanka Chopra</a> </strong>have found wedded bliss, the same way Kevin has it with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Danielle Jonas</strong></a>. Joe seemed to have a loving marriage with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a>, but in Sept. 2023, it was reported the two were planning on getting a divorce.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Despite the reported struggles between Joe and Sophie, love has been inspirational for the Jonas Brothers, both off and on the stage, over the years. On May 12, 2023, the brothers released The Album, their sixth studio album. Released four years after their comeback record (Happiness Begins), The Album gave the brothers their 26th entry on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>To celebrate the launch of The Album, the brothers stopped by the new SiriusXM Miami Studios to speak with SiriusXM Hits 1 Miami hosts <strong>Mack & Jen</strong>. During the visit, the brothers were asked what their wives’ favorite songs off The Album were. “I actually don’t know. [Priyanka] loves ‘Wings,'” said Nick. “‘Summer Baby’ as well, which we’re playing today.” “I think it’s ‘Walls.’ Pretty sure it’s ‘Walls,'” Joe said of Sophie’s choice, “She gets mad if it’s not on the setlist. I’m going to go with ‘Walls.'” “Danielle loves ‘Little Bird’ and ‘Vacation Eyes,'” added Kevin.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As the brothers go through the ups and downs of their love lives, let’s take a romantic walk down memory lane to learn about their respective wives and romances.</p><h2>Joe Jonas’ Wife Sophie Turner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Jonas-Brothers-Couples-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sophie </a>have been together since 2016 and got engaged in October 2017. They surprised everyone when they decided to get married in a quickie <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vegas wedding</a> on May 1, 2019. <strong>Diplo</strong> even live-streamed the ceremony, becoming the couple’s unofficial wedding videographer. The couple had another, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>larger wedding ceremony</a> in the summer of 2019 complete with loved ones in attendance and all of the traditions of classic nuptials.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Joe and Sophie have been so supportive of each other, and always made us melt when they lovingly stared into each other’s eyes on red carpets. In one of the Jonas Brothers’ songs, titled “Hesitate,” <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe sings about Sophie</a>. “You saved me once, and now I’ll save you too/I won’t hesitate for you,” he croons in the tune. The couple took a major step in their marriage in July 2020, when <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they welcomed their first child</a>! Sophie gave birth to the couple’s daughter&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Willa Jonas</strong></a>. Two years later, in July 2022, Joe and Sophie welcomed their <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>second daughter</a>. They have not revealed their youngest child’s name yet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>In May 2023, Sophie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>accidentally posted a video</a> of her eldest daughter, Willa, on Instagram. It was the first time that the former Game of Thrones star shared anything about her eldest daughter on social media. She later deleted the piece and explained why she has kept her children out of the public eye.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“We have always advocated for our kids’ rights to privacy so sharing this publicly is against anything I stand for,” she wrote. “Our children deserve the right to grow up out of the public eye, to learn and grow in private. If I ever were to post anything of our kids, know that it is unquestionably a mistake. I would greatly appreciate if anyone who has reposted on any other platform, please delete the video.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In Sept. 2023, it was reported that sadly Joe and Sophie were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>headed for a divorce</a>. Multiple sources told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>that they were having “serious problems” in their marriage as far back as six months, and Joe had also reportedly consulted with two divorce lawyers in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Nick Jonas’ Wife Priyanka Chopra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Jonas-Brothers-Couples-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nick</a>&nbsp;also sings about his love, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Priyanka</a>,&nbsp;on the Jonas Brothers’ 2019 album. He wrote the song “I Believe” as a love letter to his wife. “Well, call me crazy / And people saying that we move too fast / But I’ve been waiting, and for a reason / Ain’t no turning back,” Nick sings about Priyanka. The singer and the actress have had quite a whirlwind romance. They had only been dating a few months before <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nick popped the question</a> in July 2018. They married just a few months later in December 2018 with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two stunning, traditional wedding ceremonies</a>, including one in Priyanka’s homeland of India, complete with all of the traditions that are important to her and her family.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In January 2022, Nick and Priyanka welcomed their first child, daughter <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Malti</strong></a>, via surrogacy. The news was a surprise to fans, as they did not confirm that a baby was on the way. Nick and Priyanka’s daughter had to be kept in the NICU for nearly four months after her birth. Thankfully, Nick and Priyanka were able to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bring her home</a> by Mother’s Day 2022, and they’ve absolutely adored every second with their baby girl since!</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>In May 2023, Priyanka acknowledged that if she had to choose between motherhood and her career, she would go with her daughter. “My career matters. And I didn’t even think about it until I was writing my book. And then it dawned on me like now I’m in my 40s,” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she said in an interview with Femina magazine</a>. “And that, if I were asked to give up my career and just move countries, I would do it without question for my daughter.”</p><h2>Kevin Jonas’ Wife Danielle Jonas</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Jonas-Brothers-Couples-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kevin </a>and<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Danielle</a>, celebrated their 13th wedding anniversary in Dec. 2022. The couple has two adorable daughters together: <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Valentina Angelina Jonas</strong>, 6, and <strong>Alena Rose Jonas</strong>, 9</a>. In the JoBros’ documentary, Chasing Happiness, Nick and Joe predicted Kevin would marry Danielle. Their prediction was totally spot on. Kevin and Danielle are a fairly private couple, but they love to share precious moments, and photos from their life on the ‘Gram, and fans cannot get enough of it. The Jonas Brothers may have had to chase happiness for a while, but their journeys led them straight to Sophie, Priyanka, and Danielle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mopZqrXZe%2FsMDHnqmsZaeew6a%2FjGxtbGhhZX1w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./protestors-burn-american-flag-outside-jason-aldeans-concert.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Protestors Burn American Flag Outside Jason Aldeans Concert</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jordan-feliz-19890315-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jordan Feliz (Gospel Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
