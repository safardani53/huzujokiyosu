While it claimed to help people with self-doubts and deliver personal growth, it secretly forced women participants to be called slaves, be involved in outrageous activities, and provide&nbsp;potentially damaging information (nude pictures, testimonials) as collateral&nbsp;for being part of the organization.</p><p>Eventually, several women stepped forward to expose the atrocities being committed by several people in NXIVM under the guise of empowerment.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Kreuk and her ex-boyfriend, Mark Hildreth, were also put in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spotlight</a>&nbsp;when they were named as members of NXIVM. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rolling Stone</a>’s coverage of the story, Nicole — a victim who was forced to become Allison Mack’s (she played Chloe Sullivan in Smallville) slave —&nbsp;was introduced to the Source, an acting curriculum under the NXIVM umbrella by&nbsp;Kreuk&nbsp;ex-boyfriend Hildreth. In the same article, Kreuk was also alleged as a former NXIVM member. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Kreuk&nbsp;Says the Accusations of Her Recruiting Sex Slaves Are Blatantly False</h2><p>Kreuk&nbsp;explained&nbsp;her involvement with NXIVM and&nbsp;addressed all the allegations during her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Elle magazine in March 2018.&nbsp;The actress explained that though she was a part of NXIVM, she had never come across anything illegal or nefarious.</p><p>She also called the accusations of her being in the “inner circle” and recruiting women as “sex slaves” blatantly false. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The accusations that I was in the 'inner circle' or recruited women as 'sex slaves' are blatantly false.</p><p>Besides, she shared the reason why she had been a part of the organization. She stated that&nbsp;she had taken self-help/personal growth courses that helped handle her previous shyness.</p><p>"...what I understood to be a self-help/personal growth course that helped me handle my previous shyness, which is why I continued with the program," the actress said.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Kreuk further&nbsp;thanked all the victims who had come forward to expose DOS's wrongdoings (an alleged all-female sex cult within NXIVM). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her full statement read:</p><p>When I was about 23, I took an Executive Success Programs/NXIVM “intensive,” what I understood to be a self-help/personal growth course that helped me handle my previous shyness, which is why I continued with the program. I left about five years ago and had minimal contact with those who were still involved. The accusations that I was in the “inner circle” or recruited women as “sex slaves” are blatantly false. During my time, I never experienced any illegal or nefarious activity. I am horrified and disgusted by what has come out about DOS. Thank you to all of the brave women who have come forward to share their stories and expose DOS; I can’t imagine how difficult this has been for you. I am deeply disturbed and embarrassed to have been associated with NXIVM. I hope the investigation leads to justice for all of those affected.</p><h2>Is Kreuk Married after Her Relationship with Hildreth?</h2><p>The Burden of Truth actress was&nbsp;in a relationship with Canadian actor Mark Hildreth —&nbsp;best known for his roles in Resurrection (2014) and American Pastoral (2016)&nbsp;— for quite some time.</p><p>They had started <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating</a> in 2004 and broke off their relationship somewhere before 2013. After breaking up,&nbsp;Hildreth <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dated</a> an actress named&nbsp;Nicole. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Likewise,&nbsp;Kreuk was also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumored</a> of&nbsp;dating her&nbsp;Smallville&nbsp;co-star&nbsp;Jensen Ackles, who played&nbsp;the&nbsp;character of Teague in the series.&nbsp;</p><p>But, since Kreuk parted ways with Hildreth, her relationship status has been concealed. She has neither shared any boyfriend figure in her social media nor been romantically linked with anyone.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Therefore, it seems like the actress is single for now. However, it could also be that she is dating or married but has decided to keep the information just to herself.
