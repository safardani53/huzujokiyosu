No one's child.</p><p>"This is abuse. Not ok. The threats. Not ok. The fear mongering, not ok."</p><p>But Kimora wasn't finished lashing out, and returned to Instagram demanding Russell leave their kids alone.</p><p>She said: "This is how you maneuver with the world and women all around you.</p><p>"Your threats and lies and intimidation maneuvers and tactics are sad."</p><p>Then she begged him to stop: "Your own flesh and blood?
