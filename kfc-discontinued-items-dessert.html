BEYOND CHICKEN</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/beyond-fried-chicken-kfc-s-821769321.jpg><p>With the craze that centered around plant-based meat alternatives in the past few years, it’s no surprise that KFC wanted to capitalize on the trend and launch its own Kentucky style Beyond chicken.</p><p>Through its partnership with Beyond Meat, KFC truly did make a splash on the plant-based meat scene – at least for a time.</p><p>The soy and wheat-based product quickly sold out when it was introduced to Atlanta stores in 2019.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>But when the nuggets were offered nationally, demand fell short.</p><p>Many customers complained about the taste or found the texture off-putting.</p><p>And for those who cared about the plant-based nuggets actually not containing meat, there were concerns as well.</p><p>The Beyond Meat Fried Chicken was fried with the same oil as the regular chicken, leading to potential cross contamination for customers.</p><p>Plus, prices were higher, making the whole Beyond chicken entree a little lackluster as an option.</p><p>However, when news arrived that the KFC Beyond Chicken would be no more, fans of the plant-based option were in shock.</p><p>“This is devastating,” one Reddit shopper said at the time. “I really enjoyed them.”</p><p>Another fan wrote: “I’m craving it so bad right now.&nbsp; I’m so disappointed it’s discontinued.”</p><h2>2. CHEETOS SANDWICH</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/kfc-cheetos-sandwich-bye-now-821769327.jpg><p>Unlike the Beyond Chicken KFC offered, the Cheetos Sandwich was full of authentic chicken meat – plus the unorthodox sandwich topping of cheetos.</p><p>The Cheetos Sandwich first launched in 2019, and at first glance, it appeared fans were excited to try the zany menu innovation.</p><p>Many praised the sandwich, which contained a chicken patty with Cheetos, mayonnaise, Cheetos sauce and a basic hamburger bun.</p><p>New Yorkers got to try the menu entree alongside a KFC Mac and Cheetos Bowl, Cheetos hot wings and Cheetos fries at a pop-up event.</p><p>However, the fun didn’t last because KFC stopped offering the entree nationwide shortly after.</p><p>It’s possible that the novelty wore off because while many customers couldn’t wait to try the sandwich concoction, many were unlikely to incorporate it into their regular diets.</p><p>“I love that we're all pretty much in agreement we're gonna try this thing but just feel ashamed about it,” one Redditor said when the sandwich was announced.</p><h2>3. APPLE TURNOVER</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/kfc-apple-pie-bye-now-821769326.jpg><p>What better dessert to pair with your Kentucky fried chicken than a treat that tastes exactly like apple pie?</p><p>The KFC turnover was made with an apple-cinnamon filling enclosed within a flaky breaded crust.</p><p>Since the days of the apple turnover’s departure, KFC customers have been sorely disappointed with the chain’s dessert options.</p><p>Now you can choose between a basic chocolate chip cookie or a chocolate Bundt cake, but some fans are still&nbsp; begging for the apple turnover to make a comeback.</p><h2>4. KENTUCKY CHICKEN FLAVORED ICE CREAM</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/kfcs-kentucky-fried-chicken-flavored-821769328.jpg><p>This one either sounds like something you absolutely have to try or a dessert you’ll be running for the hills away from.</p><p>Shoppers were initially either disturbed and intrigued by the unorthodox ice cream flavor.</p><p>The treat was meant to provide customers with that “sweet and salty” flavor profile so many crave, but it never got off the ground as a well-liked item at KFC.</p><p>When it was announced, a Redditor wrote, “I'd try it. Sweet and salty often makes for a great dessert.”</p><p>Still, many others expressed their horror that such an ice cream flavor would ever exist.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Kroger</a> has received a wave of backlash after discontinuing several of its shoppers’ <a href=#>favorite products.</a></p><p>Plus, here are the <a href=#>five Burger King items</a> you’ll never see again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbX92fZJvZ2ijlph6pbXSnKanrJmjwqawjKKrnqWjYrGmv9Keqa1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-laura-zerra-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Laura Zerra Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julien-laurens.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Julien Laurens net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
