"He didn't know what to do, and eventually I just kind of stopped and snapped out of whatever that was."</p><p>After the incident, Amber tried to act normal, and she suggested that the two just go to bed.</p><p>"The next morning, he told me that happened and I had zero recollection whatsoever," Amber continued.
