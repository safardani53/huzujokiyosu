(Duff and Madden, 44, were linked when she was a teenager from 2004 until 2006.)</p><p>“This!!!” she wrote over a video of the band performing alongside an astonished face emoji, alongside a series of other clips and snaps from the concert.</p><p>The Lizzie McGuire alum wed <a href=#><strong>Matthew Koma</strong></a> in December 2019. The couple share <a href=#>daughter Banks</a>, 4, and <a href=#>daughter Mae</a>, 2. Duff also shares son Luca, 11, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Mike Comrie</strong></a>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Duff shared that not only is she <a href=#>on good terms with her ex</a>, but she and Koma also spend time with Madden’s wife, <a href=#><strong>Nicole Richie</strong></a>. (Madden and the Simple Life alum, 42,<a href=#> tied the knot</a>&nbsp;in December 2010 after four years of dating.)</p><p>“I have a good relationship with their whole family,” Duff said during a January appearance on Watch What Happens Live. “We actually hang out all the time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hilary-Duff-and-Husband-Matthew-Koma-Goes-to-Ex-Joel-Madden-s-Good-Charlotte-Concert-340.jpg><p>The foursome, who often go hiking together, are also all neighbors. “I was just in [Richie’s] driveway, honking for her to come drink wine with us the other day,” Duff told <strong><a href=#>Andy Cohen</a></strong>, adding that Richie couldn’t make it because she was “asleep by 8.”</p><p>Despite her past with the rocker, Duff shared that her husband is not phased by their friendship and has even enjoyed playing a few pranks on them.</p><p>“My husband is a giant troll, it’s one of my favorite things about him,” Duff explained at the time. “Right when they moved in, for some reason Matt photoshopped a picture of Joel and [brother <a href=#><strong>Benji Madden</strong></a>] in a photo with me on Valentine’s Day with like, ‘Happy Valentine’s Day, honey.’”</p><p>In February 2022, the <a href=#>group of four</a> were seen dining together with friends in Los Angeles, which Duff said “blew the whole world’s mind for a hot second.”</p><p>But the pair have always been on friendly terms. A year after their split, Madden shared that the pair continue to keep in touch.</p><p>“Every girl I’ve ever dated I have respect for, and I always try to leave them on good terms,” he said during a March 2007 interview with People. “I don’t see the necessity to be friends with anyone you’ve dated but definitely out of respect of the time, you have to be kind of respectful and that’s what I try to do.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He also went on to address the controversy over their nine-year age gap and said he “ignored” what people said about his relationship with Duff.</p><p>“People can say or think whatever they want … so in my reality, it’s kind of irrelevant,” Madden said at the time. “I’m always the kind of person that does the right thing and keeps my side of the street clean.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahoZyWv7p5w66dn2WRo7FutNSsmZqmlGK6osDToZywZZukuqJ5wK2rnqaUYrK5ecmonKVlnZaxpbHNrGScp56YsrPAjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-priscilla-presley-riley-keough-fight-over-lisa-maries-trust.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Priscilla Presley and Riley Keough's Fight Over Lisa Marie's Trust</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-machi-transgender.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here Is Why Fans Believe Joe Machi Is A Transgender Person</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
