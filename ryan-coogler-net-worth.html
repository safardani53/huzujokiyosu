Aside from Black Panther, Ryan is responsible for writing and directing major films that received international attention, including Fruitvale Station.</p><p>While Ryan’s celebrity status has been cemented with his amazing contributions in the film world, he unfortunately was recently subjected to mistreatment. With news of the 35-year-old being detained making its rounds, social media users have questions. What is Ryan Coogler’s net worth? Has the filmmaker been arrested? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ryan Coogler’s net worth is set to multiply.</h2><p>As of this writing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Ryan has earned a net worth of $25 million. This number is the result of a combination of his work as a film director, screenwriter, boom editor, sound writer, sound mixer, and assistant cameraman.</p><p>Along with Black Panther — which made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly $1.4 billion worldwide</a> — Ryan is the director and writer behind the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station and Creed. Both of these films combined brought in $191 million worldwide. As Ryan continues with his journey on directing and storytelling, it’s safe to assume that his net worth will continue to blossom over time.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Ryan Coogler</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Film director, Screenwriter</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $25 Million</p><p>Ryan Coogler is an American film director and screenwriter who has gained fame for writing and directing the films Fruitvale Station, Creed, and Marvel's Black Panther.</p><p><strong>Birthdate: </strong>May 23, 1986</p><p><strong>Birth name:</strong> Ryan Kyle Coogler</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Oakland, Calif.</p><p><strong>Father:</strong> Ira Coogler</p><p><strong>Mother: </strong>Joselyn Thomas</p><p><strong>Marriages: </strong>Zinzi Evans (m. 2016)</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> California State University</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ryan Coogler was temporarily detained by Atlanta police after falsely being accused of robbing a bank in January 2022.</h2><p>Why on earth would an accomplished film director attempt to rob a bank? This is the million-dollar question social media users have on their minds. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, the filmmaker was temporarily detained in January 2022 after bank workers mistakenly believed he was staging a robbery.</p><p>An Atlanta Police Department report obtained by the outlet states that Ryan was briefly detained after heading to a Bank of America location to make a $12,000 withdrawal. Following normal COVID-19 protocols, Ryan entered the bank with a mask on. He was also wearing sunglasses. He proceeded to hand the bank teller a withdrawal slip with a note written on the back.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The message read: "I would like to withdraw $12,000 cash from my checking account. Please do the money count somewhere else. I'd like to be discreet."</p><p>Of course, this is all pretty understandable since openly discussing his withdrawal amount could make Ryan a target. However, the note apparently made the bank teller believe that something sinister was happening, and they called the authorities.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This Ryan Coogler bank situation has me spooked because the bank teller literally could have caused this man’s death.

After an investigation, they concluded that it was all a huge misunderstanding and the person to blame was the Bank of America teller.</p><p>Naturally, many social media users are pissed about the report, since Ryan has no reason to rob a bank. Furthermore, people are saying that if Ryan was white, this entire incident would have been handled differently.</p><p>Ryan has moved on from the unfortunate incident. The 35-year-old later told TMZ that all is OK.</p><p>"This situation should never have happened. However, Bank of America worked with me and addressed it to my satisfaction and we have moved on," Ryan said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I reiterate my gratitude that Ryan Coogler is still with us.
