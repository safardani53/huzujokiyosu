The response from the public has been overwhelming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"During this first encounter with Owen, he reminded me so much of my son—full of energy and life. Owen’s innocence is captivating, and he teaches us to love freely without hate," Sims adds. "Owen is what it’s all about and who we should all strive to be more like, spreading kindness, joy, and love. I’m glad this is reaching so many people and bringing much happiness to this holiday season.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, Lillian says that the lesson from the experience is that the little things matter.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“How [Sims] interacted with Owen was so special and brought a smile to our faces the rest of the day.
