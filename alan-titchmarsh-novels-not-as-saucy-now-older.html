Maybe it’s because I’ve got older and less racy myself. I don’t know.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re love stories. Romantic adventures is what they are really. Sometimes you’ve got to show how attracted people are to one another.”</p><p>The author added he was left red-faced reading out the sex scenes for his audiobooks.&nbsp;</p><p>During lockdown, Alan has been able to work with <a href=#>his wife of 45 years, Alison</a>, for the first time on his Grow Your Own series.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000584364774.jpg><p>He said: “She’s not done so much as take a snap on her mobile phone and really she doesn’t take photos at all. And there she was wielding a camera and filming television programmes. I think she was quietly chuffed with herself. I was certainly chuffed with her. She did really well.”</p><p><a href=#>The green-fingered star</a> added that she now critiques television programmes for their techniques and prepared a speech in case they won a TV Bafta.</p><p>Alison might yet have a shot at the accolade as Alan is still being offered and turning down work.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>He said: “I’m quite picky, not least because I think people can have too much of you. I like to do things that are stimulating, that are challenging, rather than just ploughing the same old furrow. But at the same time, I don’t want to embarrass people.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’re not going to be loved by everybody, some people say ‘oh not him again’. But you can’t really think about them but I am aware of the fact of not overdoing it.&nbsp;</p><p>“Not being all things to all men all the time. You’ve got to pace yourself a bit. Just keep doing it well and I do love what I do.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Alan Titchmarsh claims the Queen once told him he 'gives a lot of ladies a lot of pleasure'</span><p><strong>GOT a story?
