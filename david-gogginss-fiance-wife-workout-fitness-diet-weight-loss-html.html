His ex-wife was very supportive in his endeavors.</p><p>In 2010, when they were still together, Aleeza <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> with Stars and Stripes&nbsp;why the ultra-distance cyclist thought he had to participate in those races.

So, let's take a look at his history.</p><p>At the age of 24, the former United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party member&nbsp;was depressed and weighed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">290 pounds</a>. After watching a commercial, he decided to join the most challenging program in the world—the Navy SEAL's training program. He was laughed at because of his weight<span>;</span> however,&nbsp;with his determination and the help of an intense fitness routine, he lost <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">100 pounds</a> in 59 days and completed the program. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>His weight loss journey during the training program isn't the only commendable feat.&nbsp;He is one of the world’s best <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">endurance athletes</a> who has completed over 60 ultra-marathons, triathlons, and ultra-triathlons. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Goggins is also a one-time world <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">record holder</a> for most pull-ups done in 24 hours or less, with 4030 pull-ups in just 17!&nbsp;He was able to break the record after two failed attempts, during which he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">incurred injuries</a>.</p><p>In addition to that, he has also written a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">self-help memoir</a>,&nbsp;Can’t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,&nbsp;to share his life story and inspire people to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite all the achievements, recognition is not what he's looking for.&nbsp;According to his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official site</a>, “For him, physical and mental suffering are a journey of self-discovery, no other experience makes him feel more clear, focused and alive.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mut7XDZp6on5eeu7S%2FjJ%2BgmqaTmnpuw8ifnGavn6e4sMHTZp2irJ6awLR5w6KcrWWnmraotNNmo6iro2O1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jared-goff-christen-harpers-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jared Goff, Christen Harpers Relationship Timeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dakota-johnsons-2018-venice-film-festival-wavy-hair-how-to.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dakota Johnsons 2018 Venice Film Festival Wavy Hair: How-to</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
