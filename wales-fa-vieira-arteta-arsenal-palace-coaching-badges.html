He has done a lot of coaching and got a lot of hours in. He has left a lot of us behind.</p><p>"So I think him passing and getting that done could be the kick up the backside the rest of us need.</p><p>"I could make excuses that there is not enough time or it is difficult when you are playing but I have been a little bit lazy if I am being honest.</p><p>"I could probably have put a few more hours into it but there is plenty of time for that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6fbc0f5d-33f0-420f-bf09-3711aaf41b49.jpg><p>Even the next generation of stars have signed up with the future of Welsh coaching burning bright.</p><p>Current Wales defender Ben Davies as well as women's star Natasha Harding have enrolled.</p><p>Ex-Dragons and West Ham defender James Collins, former<a href=#> Manchester City</a> ace Yaya Toure and Newcastle and Argentina centre-back Federico Fernandez are also in line.</p><p>And there are more.</p><p>French duo Gael Clichy and Yohan Cabaye, who both starred in the Prem for <a href=#>Arsenal</a>, Man City, Newcastle and Palace respectively, have also decided to follow the Welsh coaching pathway.</p><p>Former Newcastle defender Jean-Alain Boumsong has worked with Wales Under-15s on his pro licence earlier this month.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Adams said: "Our strength in delivering reality-based coach education is to provide individual coach mentors, who support each coach in their transition from player to coach."</p><p>â½<strong> Read our <strong><a href=#>Football news live blog</a></strong></strong> <strong>for the very latest rumours, gossip and done deals</strong></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Wales boss Robert Page unsure of future and doesnât know if he will be in charge for World Cup play-off in March</span><p>--</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2aDeIGVbGpsZ6eWuaa%2FjJ%2BYZq6ZmrazrYyaqa2dpJZ6or7SnqWapF2lrq2twp5knKeRmLWqusZmmZqcl5rAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ian-kinsler.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ian Kinsler Bio [2023 Update]: Early Life, Wife &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeremy-o-harris.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Jeremy O.
