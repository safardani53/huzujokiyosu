you don't need to read the whole article but read the headlines.</p><p>“Become aware of what makes a good quiz question, and I do crossword puzzles, both cryptic and general knowledge, which is a form of brain training.</p><p>“You can never be over-prepared for a quiz - you can never know enough and you can't possibly know everything. So just keep learning.” </p><h2>KNOW YOUR WEAKNESSES</h2><p>Kevin Ashman, who still holds the highest record score on Mastermind on tackling areas of weakness:</p><p>“Tackling areas of weakness is not rocket science - even if it is rocket science. </p><p>“Do not avoid your weak subjects. You may not feel entirely comfortable with them, but it makes a difference if you can visit some sites associated with that subject.</p><p>“For example, in the case of science, maybe a visit to a science museum - who knows what you might find there that would pique your interest?</p><p>“There are certain things that just come up again and again so they really are amongst the first things you need to look at. </p><p>“One of those is the periodic table.</p><p>“Science is something that not everybody is particularly happy with to begin with, but if you learn the periodic table, that's a very useful thing and can give you an entry into all kinds of other aspects of science.</p><p>“Find your curiosity, build on it, don't be afraid of your weak areas.” </p><p>Lisa Taylor on choosing your quiz team:</p><p>“Try and build a team where you're covering a lot of different areas of knowledge.</p><p>“Bring in your classicists and your heavy metal enthusiasts and juxtapose with your scientists and your foodies.</p><p>“You've got to make sure that you've covered as many bases as possible with the people that you've got.</p><p>“Make sure that the people that you are quizzing with are people that you know and trust and can have a proper good discussion with. </p><p>“It's better to have people who think like you, and whose brain works like yours because it's so much easier to work with them.”</p><h2>KEEP CALM</h2><p>Pat Gibson’s insider knowledge on how to keep calm under pressure.</p><p>“Pressure arises if you really want to win and dealing with that pressure is important.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“Panicking, doesn't help. If it did, I would recommend it!</p><p>“I don't think I'm terribly superstitious, apart from being fed, watered and rested prior to a quiz.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686614234.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Eggheads star Dave Rainford agrees to Les Miserables date with teammate Daphne Fowler after nearly bungling quiz question</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun Showbiz team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlmaX56g5VsZqqtma96tLTOsGSen5edsqKw0majmq2emLWmv4yfqZ6dXaKutMDEq5qlmaOoerHBwWaorqGqZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tomoya-kanki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tomoya Kanki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./phil-cuzzi.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Phil Cuzzi</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
