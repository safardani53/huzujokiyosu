It’s&nbsp;very segregated and not the easiest place to grow up as a young gay man."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Sylvester went on to explain that he was often bullied for being who he was.</p><p>"I knew from the age of 5 that I was different," he continued.</p><p>"I was Black and gay in all-Black community. And I was also Black and gay at an all-white private school. I used to run through the woods to escape the kids that tormented me when I was growing up."</p><p>All along, Sylvester knew who he was, but he was still not out to his family.</p><p>However, that changed once he got a job as Richards' personal assistant.</p><p>"My first job was working for Kyle Richards," Sylvester continued.</p><p>"She was on 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.' I started with her from Season One, and during Season Two, someone had a 'Gays and Gals' party. She sat me down and she said, 'I really want you to come with me,&nbsp;but I know you’re not out to your family.

I knew I could never be in front of the camera because of the shame I would bring all my family."&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Justin Sylvester in a relationship? &nbsp;</h2><p>Despite being in the public eye, Sylvester is known for keeping his personal life private, as not much information is available on his <a href=#>dating history</a>.</p><p>However, in May 2022, Sylvester got real about his dating life and revealed that he had been dumped last minute via text by his date to the <a href=#>White House Correspondents' Dinner</a>.</p><p>Sylvester revealed the news to Kotb while appearing on Today.</p><p>"I ... rolled in&nbsp;and&nbsp;asked Jeff in March like, 'Hey, what's going on? Are we still going to the White House Correspondents' Dinner? I need to get my&nbsp;Tom Ford (suit) taken in,'" Sylvester told Kotb, via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Today</a>.</p><p>Shortly after sending that text, he revealed that his date dumped him.</p><p>&nbsp;"Jeff told me that he found somebody else," Sylvester revealed.</p><p>Despite the disappointment, the universe had other plans for Sylvester at the prestigious dinner.</p><p>"Did I tell y’all the universe and I, we were sorority sisters and she owes me a favor? Cuz the universe always comes through," he explained.</p><p>At the event, Sylvester was honored with the WHCD Freedom of the Press Junket Award by comedian Billy Eichner.</p><p>"For his courageous work interviewing The Jonas Brothers while they filmed a new commercial for Tostitos, we present the WHCD Freedom of the Press Junket Award to E! News’ 'Daily Pop's' Justin Sylvester,'" Eichner said.</p><p>"Can you imagine standing me up and (Billy Eichner) gives me an award at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner?"
