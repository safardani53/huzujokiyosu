</a>earlier this year, reached out to Hannah after her social media snaps caught his eye.</p><p>One said: “Sam thinks Hannah is absolutely stunning and has been liking her pictures like crazy, which is of course very flattering for her.</p><p>“She has also followed him back and they are getting on very well.<br>“It’s a case of watch this space.”</p><p>Sam, who was first tipped for great things
