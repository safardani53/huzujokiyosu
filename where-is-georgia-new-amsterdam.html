While Dr. Bloom's (Janet Montgomery) absence is fully understandable given her inpatient rehab stint, the more troubling AWOL character is Georgia Goodwin (Lisa O'Hare), wife of medical director Max Goodwin (Ryan Eggold).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In fact, Dr. Goodwin's perpetually pregnant spouse (seriously, is she ever having that baby?) hasn't been seen since March 5, when she and Max attended Lamaze classes together&nbsp;in S1E15, "Croaklahoma." Fans of the NBC medical drama are rightfully wondering, "where the heck is Max's wife?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">No, really, where is Georgia on New Amsterdam?</h2><p>The worry definitely increased in the blizzard episode, when the writers really seemed to be leaning into the possible romantic chemistry between Dr. Goodwin and Dr. Sharpe (Freema Agyeman). Plus, as Max's cancer treatments intensify, it's been strange not to see his wife by his side during any of his radiation and chemotherapy appointments.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, it'll be a while longer before viewers will see Georgia, but she's not gone for good. According to IMDb, Lisa O'Hare appears in the season finale, "Luna," which is slated to air May 14, and it should prove to be a big scene for her character.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Lisa's sporadic appearances on the show are likely due to her real-life maternity leave. Off-screen, the actress gave birth to her second child, a daughter named Avery, in late March. And it seems the final episode of the season will bring the birth of her character's baby if the title is a clue. Luna was Max's sister, and it seems almost certain he would make the baby namesake to her late aunt.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lisa wasn't the only New Amsterdam star on maternity leave...</h2><p>In fact, Dr. Bloom's rehab stint is what enabled actress Janet Montgomery to enjoy some time off with her own newborn. While Lisa's pregnancy worked ideally with her character's arc, it wasn't quite right for Lauren's storyline, so her pregnancy was concealed with angles and wardrobe, and her absence explained by a rehab stay to deal with her Adderall dependency.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though Janet's been in the credits for the past couple episodes, she didn't have any screen time. However, she too will be back in time for the finale.&nbsp;She and her partner, Joe Fox, welcomed their first daughter, Sunday Juno Fox, just a couple weeks before Lisa's new addition made her debut.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Thankfully, it sounds like the New Amsterdam set is a welcoming place for newborns. "Went back to work this week and couldn't be more grateful to my Dam Fam for making the transition so easy," Janet wrote of her return to production three weeks ago. "Being able to have Sunday close by on set is such a luxury that most mums don't get and I don't take for granted how extremely blessed I am."</p><p>New Amsterdam airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxll5q8s7PImmSnnadirq6%2F056pnZmd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sharon-osbourne-before-and-after-facelift.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Check Out Sharon Osbourne Before and After Her Facelift: Pictures</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sexy-shirtless-abc-family-hunks-play-football-2012276.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sexy, Shirtless ABC Family Hunks Play Football!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
