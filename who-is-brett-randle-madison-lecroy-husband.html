Randle was so smitten with LeCroy that he flew to South Carolina just days after they met to take her on a date. The couple dated for about six months before he popped the question (with the help of LeCroy's son, Hudson). In November 2022, LeCroy and Randle hosted two wedding celebrations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fans of Southern Charm have probably noticed that Randle didn't appear on the most recent season of the show. He appears to be a relatively private person, and LeCroy has made it clear that she intends to respect that while maintaining her own life as a public figure. That said, he clearly doesn't mind having his picture posted on her Instagram, so fans still get some sweet glimpses into their life together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So who is Madison LeCroy's husband?

[He's] very committed and made the effort."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LeCroy has also shared that while the two have settled near Charleston, Randle <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>will "go back and forth" as needed for work</a>, but "pretty much he [will] be here [in Charleston] full time."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-proposed-to-lecroy-after-six-months-of-dating></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He proposed to LeCroy after six months of dating</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Randle asked LeCroy to marry her in October 2021, after they'd been together for six months.

Randle treated them to a limo ride and dinner before popping the question at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LeCroy shared, "The next thing you know we come back home and I'm thinking it's just a birthday dinner, and my son's over here jumping around and I turn around and my fianc√© is down on one knee and proposed to me in my living room.

Although Randle is often featured in LeCroy's Instagram posts, he's never tagged, which suggests he either doesn't have an Instagram account or wants to keep it very low-key. He also doesn't appear to have public-facing profiles on Twitter or LinkedIn, and it doesn't seem as though he's given any interviews to media outlets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LeCroy has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>joked about her husband's lack of social media</a>, saying, "He's so hot, I have to keep him off the grid so the girls will keep off. I mean, have you seen him?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July 2022, LeCroy shared that Randle wouldn't appear on season 8 of the show, saying, "That was his preference, and I have to respect people if they want their privacy. He didn't sign up for this, he just happened to fall in love with a girl who is in the media."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But she teased the possibility of Randle appearing in season 9 and beyond, saying, "Hopefully, if everything is going well who's to say we might not see him next season?" <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Season 9 of Southern Charm</a> is set to premiere in September 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She was clear about her priorities, telling PEOPLE, "I will protect Brett at all costs.
