The Utah native married into a very wealthy family with ties to a world-renowned businessman, pilot, and film producer. Heather went on to get divorced, open her own business, and write a book detailing her decision to distance herself from the Mormon church.</p><p>So what has all of this amounted to when it comes to the <a href=#>sometimes-brash reality star’s net worth</a>? Here’s what we know about the small fortune Heather has amassed so far.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Heather Gay’s net worth came at a price.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>As the mom of three <a href=#>previously explained</a> on RHOSLC, "I married into a family of extreme wealth. Howard Hughes comes in, hires my grandfather-in-law as his driver and henchman. Howard Hughes loved the Mormons and when he passed, the Gay family inherited a huge portion of his estate. The Gay family is worth billions, so I basically married into Mormon royalty."</p><p>However, Heather’s fairytale ended, and she is now divorced. “I didn’t know how to function,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> in 2020 about the seemingly-messy split, adding, “I had <a href=#>three little kids</a> and I didn’t know how to do it and nobody gave me any guidance.” Although Heather has talked openly about continuing to get financial support from her ex, the Bravolebrity is also doing a lot on her own now too. She has amassed a decent net worth of $1.7 million, according to multiple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Heather Gay</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">reality star</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $1.7 million</p><p>Heather Gay is a reality star who has appeared on Bravo's The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City since Season 1.

To give you an idea of how much a typical treatment might cost, the spa’s patented <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mini Lip Plump</a> service will run you a cool $350. Meanwhile, a butt lift will set you back $6,000 at the Utah-based establishment that Heather founded with her best friend.</p><p>The admitted Botox addict also penned a highly-anticipated book called Bad Mormon that is hitting bookshelves on February 7, 2023, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Titbit</a>. Heather often promotes the tome to her 466,000 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> followers — and by the way, fans can also buy merchandise associated with Bad Mormon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbKiwMeeqWafka56r7HTZq6oqqSd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gabby-prescod-get-to-know-summer-house-season-7-newbie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gabby Prescod: Get to Know Summer House Season 7 Newbie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chase-bank-closed-account-abroad.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'I'm panicking bad' after Chase Bank closed my account with little explanation when I was abroad - I</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
