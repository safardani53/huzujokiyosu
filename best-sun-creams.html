Plus, most sunscreens come in two formulas; mineral - which creates a physical barrier on top of the skin, and chemical - which absorb and release from the skin. Both are effective and it's up to your personal preference on which one to use. </span><span>Whether you're looking for sensitive skin, once-a-day, or high SPF, our reviews of the best sun creams below have got you covered.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Best sun creams at a glance:</h2><h2>Coola Classic Sunscreen Spray SPF30 and SPF50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2956.png><ul><li><strong>Coola Classic Sunscreen Spray, £27 from Space NK - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 30 or 50, UVA and UVB protection, pollution protection packed with moisturising ingredients, non-sticky, fast-absorbing, reef safe, recyclable packaging, vegan, cruelty-free, reef-friendly, water and sweat resistant</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p>Coola's sunscreen spray is hands down the most pleasurable, luxurious sunscreen out there. We've been using this brand's products for at least four years, and it's our go-to for everything from beach holidays to pub garden days.</p><p>This product comes in SPF30 and SPF50 and a range of scents, and we tried both the SPF30 in Pina Colada and the SPF50 in Guava Mango. Right off the bat, we can confirm that these sprays smell exactly how you'd expect them to based on their names. They're sweet, tropical, and will remind you of holiday, even if you're just sunning yourself in your back garden. Plus, we love that the scents surprisingly linger on your skin like a perfume. It also sinks in really quickly and leaves no white cast whatsoever.</p><p>This is the ultimate SPF for lazy people, since the spray comes out so fine that there's no need to rub it in with your hands and get mucky. All you need to do is mist it on your skin from four to six inches away. But, if you're spraying on your face, you'll need to spray it into your hands first before rubbing onto the face.</p><p>We tested both of these out on a weekend seaside break during the UK heatwave and can confirm that, even though it feels as if you're wearing nothing on your skin, this SPF spray really will protect your skin from UVA and UVB rays and pollution damage for hours on end. Just make sure you're applying liberally and reapplying every couple of hours (or more frequently if you're swimming or sweating heavily).</p><p>Unlike a lot of spray SPFs, this one isn't full of drying alcohol. It contains a host of moisturising and nourishing ingredients like safflower extract, meadowfoam seed oil, buriti, vitamin A and vitamin E.</p><p>Another great thing about Coola? The products are kind to the environment. They're made using 70% organically sourced ingredients, they're cruelty free, and the packaging is made from 100% recyclable sugar-cane resin. Also, because the products don't contain Oxybenzone or Octinoxate, they're reef compliant.</p><p><b>Type of Sunscreen: </b><span>Chemical;</span><b>&nbsp;SPF Factor:</b><span> 30 or 50; </span><b>Water-Resistant: </b><span>Yes;</span><b>&nbsp;Size:</b><span> 177ml; </span><strong>Star ingredients:</strong> safflower extract, meadowfoam seed oil, buriti and vitamin A and E; <b>Vegan: </b><span>Yes</span></p><h2>Piz Buin Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_1379.png><ul><li><strong>Piz Buin Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 30, £8 from Boots- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 30, UVA and UVB protection, packed with antioxidants, non-sticky, water and sweat resistant</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p>If it's a regular moisturising sun lotion you're after, you can't go wrong with this one from Piz Buin.

Check, Packed with antioxidants like FEVERFEW PFE™ to prevent premature skin ageing? Yep, Non-sticky and fast-absorbing? Got that too.</p><p>This SPF goes above just UV protection, it has triple resistance. This means it protects your skin against aggressors like chlorine and sea and salt water, too. It's also sweat and water-resistant too, which means you're less likely to be reapplying constantly.</p><p>We tested this product out when sunbathing on a sunny day in the garden and found it to be effective and incredibly moisturising on my skin (thanks to the added glycerin).</p><p><b>Type of Sunscreen: </b><span>Chemical;</span><b>&nbsp;SPF Factor:</b><span> 30+; </span><b>Water-Resistant: </b><span>No;</span><b>&nbsp;Size:</b><span> 200ml; </span><b>Star ingredients: </b>FEVERFEW PFE and glycerin ; <b>Vegan: </b><span>No</span></p><h2>Paula's Choice Advanced Sun Protection Daily Moisturiser SPF 50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_1208.jpg><ul><li><strong>Paula's Choice Advanced Sun Protection Daily Moisturiser SPF 50, £31.20 (down from £39) at Paula's Choice - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 30, UVA and UVB protection, lightweight, non-greasy, dewy glow, hydrating, no white cast, holds your makeup in place</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p>Paula's Choice is a brand loved for its exfoliants and serums, and this brand-new SPF is bound to be a hit amongst beauty fans and regular folk alike.</p><p>It protects you against both UVA and UVB rays but has larger molecules than regular SPFs so doesn't seep through to the deeper layers of your skin. The benefit of this? You're far less likely to have a sensitised response or breakout as a result of using this sun cream on your face.</p><p>The finish is dewy and non-greasy, making it ideal for wearing under makeup or alone.</p><p>It contains skin-boosting emollients that hydrate and balance your complexion and leave it feeling soft and healthy.

However, this product does.</p><p>Thanks to the added hyaluronic acid, we could ditch my regular serums and moisturisers and go straight in with this cream. So, the skin didn't feel overburdened by-products and we weren't met with any new breakouts by the end of the day.</p><p>It didn't disturb makeup application either. It didn't pill, make makeup crumble or slide around. In fact, it made a pretty good primer.</p><p>Above all, it's important to note that this SPF is factor 30 and protects against both UVA and UVB rays.</p><p><b>Type of Sunscreen:</b><span> Chemical; </span><b>SPF Factor:</b><span> 30; <strong>W</strong></span><b>ater-Resistant: </b><span>No;</span><b>&nbsp;Size:</b><span> 50ml; </span><b>Star ingredients:</b><span> Glycerin;</span><b>&nbsp;Vegan: </b><span>No</span></p><h2>Ultra Violette Preen Screen SPF 50 Reapplication Mist</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_1010.jpg><ul><li><strong>Ultra Violette Preen Screen SPF 50 Reapplication Mist, £32 from Space NK - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Is for application over makeup, comes in a mini size, SPF 50, UVA and UVB protection, skincare ingredients</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p>Ultra Violette is one of the trendiest suncare brands on the market, and its brand-new SPF50 reapplication mist is a total hit online and in my books.</p><p>The truth is, most of us think we're protecting our skin all day when we apply our SPF lotion on our faces in the morning. However, that's not totally accurate. You might not want to hear it, but SPF will only protect you for around two to six hours (depending on sun exposure and sweat), so you need to reapply throughout the day. However, you won't be doing that if you're wearing makeup. So, that's where this genius product comes into it.</p><p>It's a lightweight mist that you spray over your makeup to top up your SPF and treat your cells with skin-loving ingredients like&nbsp;niacinamide, Vitamin C and E, and aloe vera.</p><p>Since we first got my hands on this product, it's been in our desks or in our cross-body bag at all times.

All you need to do is spray it on your skin — no rubbing in is required. The mist is clear and applies semi-dry, so you just have to spray it on your body, wait a few seconds for it to dry completely and then you're good to go. We used the SPF30 version at a BBQ during the heatwave and didn't burn at all. It's so easy to use that we found ourselves actually wanting to reapply every hour or two so that we were never caught unprotected. Plus, the fact it's a mist means it cools you down.</p><p><b>Type of Sunscreen: </b><span>Chemical;</span><b>&nbsp;SPF Factor:</b><span> 30 or 50+; </span><b>Water-Resistant: </b><span>No;</span><b>&nbsp;Size:</b><span> 200ml; </span><b>Star ingredients: </b><span>Glycerin;</span><b>&nbsp;Vegan: </b><span>No</span></p><h2>Lacura Moisturising Sun Spray SPF15. 30 and 50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_1375.png><ul><li>Lacura Moisturising Sun Spray SPF15. 30 and 50, £3.49 from Aldi - buy <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></li></ul><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Available in factors 15, 30 and 50, absorbs fast, fine mist, UVA and UVB protection, lightweight, no white cast, affordable, rubs in easily, kids version is coloured to make the application more thorough&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p>Summer holidays are expensive, whether you're jetting off on an exotic beach trip or entertaining the kids at home, and staying stocked up on SPF is just another expense.

At first, it feels different to most sunscreens as it has a more gel-like consistency but once applied, it leaves the face looking smooth and matte, making it the perfect base for makeup.

The brand started out with just cleansers, toners, exfoliators, serums, moisturisers, treatments and masks, but has since expanded into SPF (and launched <a href=#>Hair Proud</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Body Proud</a>, which are pretty self-explanatory).</p><p>This cute yellow bottle might only contain 40ml of SPF, but its small size is exactly what makes it the perfect SPF to carry around.</p><p>It's a treat to use because it sinks in quickly, doesn't leave a greasy finish, and actually makes your skin look silky smooth and glowy. We'd even go as far as to say that it blurred breakouts and made us feel more confident about going makeup-free.</p><p>In terms of actual sun protection, it has a factor of 50+ and protects against UVA and UVB rays. And besides that, it contains a whole host of ingredients — like acerola cherry extract and spirulina — to brighten and soothe your skin.

Most major shops will have general sun creams available, but if you're after specific sun creams for tanning or for sensitive skin, beauty shops will have more niche products that can tailor to your needs. In addition, most shops will stock travel-sized versions which is perfect if you need one for your cabin bag. Here's a list of some of the best online shops.</p><h2>How much do sunscreens cost?</h2><p>Sun creams can range from about £5 up to around £30 but you can find plenty under £20. Some of the cheapest sunscreen brands include Altruist, Malibu and Bondi Sands, which have plenty of formulations under £10. The cheaper sunscreens will include active ingredients that provide broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays and will be enough to keep your skin shielded from the sun. More expensive sunscreens will have formulations that include higher-end ingredients to deliver additional benefits to the skin such as Vitamin E, Aloe Vera and other antioxidants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFuY2yAcYOOm5ysrF2owq95wqucmqWjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-romantic-comedies-through-the-years-movie-roles.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Guide to Jennifer Lopez's Romantic Comedies [PHOTOS]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nviodnm9tejjds3kdzhlft4s9lncsgry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Survivor Season 44 Episode 9: Under the Wing of a Dragon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
