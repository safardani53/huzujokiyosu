He might be, like, 80, but he’s [got] the body and fitness of a 30-year-old,” he told Us while promoting the arrival of <a href=#>all four Hunger Games movies</a> on Tubi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Josh-Hutcherson-Wants-to-Swap-Bodies-With-Former-Hunger-Games-Costar-Woody-Harrelson.jpg><p>Hutcherson also shared what he would do once settled in Harrelson’s body, adding: “I would just enjoy my life to the fullest, ‘cause that man is healthy. He lives in Hawaii. … He’s got it made.”</p><p>Hutcherson and Harrelson, 59, starred in all four Hunger Games films as Peeta Mellark and Haymitch Abernathy, respectively. Based on author <strong>Suzanne Collins</strong>’ acclaimed book series, the films followed Katniss Everdeen (<a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></a> ) as she voluntarily took her sister Primrose Everdeen’s (<strong>Willow Shields</strong>) place in the Hunger Games, during which two teens from each of the 12 districts are randomly selected to battle to the death.</p><p>Over the course of the franchise, <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a> (Gale Hawthorne), <a href=#><strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong></a> (Effie Trinket), <a href=#><strong>Stanley Tucci</strong></a> (Caesar Flickerman), <a href=#><strong>Donald Sutherland</strong></a> (President Coriolanus Snow), <a href=#><strong>Jeffrey Wright</strong></a> (Betee), <a href=#><strong>Sam Claflin</strong></a> (Finnick Odair), <a href=#><strong>Jena Malone</strong></a> (Johanna Mason), <a href=#><strong>Julianne Moore</strong></a> (‎President Alma Coin) and <a href=#>Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> (Plutarch Heavensbee) also starred.</p><p>Years after the last film debuted in 2015, Hutcherson <a href=#>still holds fond memories</a> about his time working on the series. The Journey to the Center of the Earth actor told Us that he would love to revisit his final year working on The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Josh-Hutcherson-Wants-to-Swap-Bodies-With-Former-Hunger-Games-Costar-Woody-Harrelson-02.jpg><p>“It was the greatest experience,” he recalled. “I know I enjoyed it at the time, but if I could go and relive it again with knowing how amazing it was now, I would. I would do that for sure.”</p><p>Hutcherson said one day that stood out to him from that time was when the cast had a fun-filled day in Berlin. “It was during the World Cup and we went. We rented bicycles and went to the Tiergarten Park in Berlin, and they had like a big outdoor projector set up and we watched Poland play the U.S., maybe,” he said. “It was just, like, steins of beer, pretzels, outside. Beautiful weather. It was glorious.”</p><p>During the month of September, Hunger Games fans were able <a href=#>to stream the film franchise</a> for free on Tubi. Hutcherson explained to Us why now is the perfect occasion to reminiscence over the action series.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Tubi has] a huge library, and the fact they’re adding Hunger Games to it, I think, is awesome,” he told Us. “Right now, especially, people need things to watch [amid the coronavirus pandemic] and they can watch this for free. … It’s very good timing.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp6OdeqnB05yfnqqjpLtuw8Cnq6xlpKR6tMPAqWSbp5SesrR51qKroWWknba0eceupaCdomK0ornErGSsrJGnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./max-muncy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Max Muncy- Wiki, Age, Wife, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cate-eliminated-undercooked-dish-masterchef.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fan Favorite Cate Was Eliminated After She Presented An Undercooked Dish In Masterchef</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billy-ray-cyrus.html>Billy Ray Cyrus Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toaster-snacks-discontinued-pop-tarts-danish-pizza.html>Five toaster treats you'll never see again and fans are longing for a taste of their childhood</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sam-levinson-wife.html>Sam Levinson's Wife, Ashley Lent Levinson, Also Works in Entertainment</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-jumps-on-the-cottagecore-trend-in-frilly-blue-dress.html>Selena Gomez Jumps on the Cottagecore Trend in Frilly Blue Dress</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stars-whove-spoken-about-ozempic-use-and-what-they-said.html>Stars Who've Spoken About Ozempic for Weight Loss (and What They've Said)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxSync.
